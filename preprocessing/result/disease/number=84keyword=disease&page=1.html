educ specul base upon the fact that there i no other identifi caus for the symptom and from infer drawn from result that ar pointer rather than litmu testresult of the small number of patient diagnos with menier s diseas who eventu have autopsi some ar found to not have endolymphat hydrop some research believ that in some patient with menier s diseas the symptom ar the result of a blood vessel
