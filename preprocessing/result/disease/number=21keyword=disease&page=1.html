can scientist predict or prevent parkinson s diseas what research i be done where can i get more inform glossaryintroduct parkinson s diseas pd i a degen disord of the central nervou system it wa first describ in by jame parkinson a british physician who publish a paper what he call the shake palsi in thi paper he describ the major sign and symptom of the diseas that would later bear hi name research suggest at least peopl in the unit state current have pd although some estim ar much higher societi pai an enorm price for pd the total cost to the nation i estim to exce billion annual the risk of pd increas with ag so it i expect that the financi and public health impact of thi diseas will increas a the popul get older what i parkinson s diseas parkinson s diseas belong to a group of condition call movem disord the four main symptom ar tremor or trembl in hand arm leg jaw or head rigid or stiff of the limb and trunk bradykinesia or slow of movem and postur instabl or impair balanc these symptom usual begin gradual and worsen with time a thei becom more pronounc patient mai have difficulti walk talk or complet other simpl task not everyon with on or more of these symptom ha pd a the symptom appear in other diseas a well pd i both chronic mean it persist over a long period of time and progress mean it symptom grow wors over time unlik measl you cannot catch parkinson diseas from someon els although some case of pd ar hereditari and can be trace to specif genet mutat most case ar sporadicthat i the diseas doe not typic run in famili pd like result from a combin of genet suscept and exposur to on or more environment factor that trigger the diseas pd i the most common form of parkinson the name for a group of disord with similar featur and symptom pd i also call idiopath pd the term idiopath mean a disord for which no caus ha been found while most form of parkinson ar idiopath there ar some case where the caus i known or suspect or where the symptom result from anoth disord what caus the diseas parkinson s diseas occur when nerv cell or neuron in the brain die or becom impair the main area affect i an area near the base of the brain call the substantia nigra normal the neuron in thi area produc an import brain chemic known a dopamin dopamin i a chemic messeng respons for transmit signal between the substantia nigra and the next relai station of the brain the corpu striatum to produc smooth purpos movem loss of dopamin result in abnorm nerv fire pattern within the brain that caus impair movem studi have shown that most peopl with parkinson s have lost to percent or more of the dopamin produc cell in the substantia nigra by the time symptom appear and that peopl with pd also have loss of the nerv end that produc the neurotransmitt norepinephrin norepinephrin which i close relat to dopamin i the main chemic messeng of the sympathet nervou system the part of the nervou system that control mani automat function of the bodi such a puls and blood pressur the loss of norepinephrin might explain sever of the non motor featur seen in pd includ fatigu and abnorm of blood pressur regul mani brain cell of peopl with pd contain lewi bodiesdeposit of the protein alpha synuclein research do not yet know why lewi bodi form or what role thei plai in the diseas some research suggest that the cell protein dispos system mai fail in peopl with pd caus protein to build up to harm level and trigger cell death addition studi have found evid that clump of protein that develop insid brain cell of peopl with pd mai contribut to the death of neuron howev the precis role of the protein deposit remain unknown some research even specul that thi protein buildup i part of an unsuccess attempt to protect the cell scientist have identifi sever genet mutat associ with pd and mani more gene have been tent link to the disord studi the gene respons for inherit case of pd can help research understand both inherit and sporad case the same gene and protein that ar alter in inherit case mai also be alter in sporad case by environment toxin or other factor research also hope that discov gene will help identifi new wai of treat pd in addition to genet environment exposur mai increas a person s risk of develop the diseas even in famili case exposur to toxin or other environment factor mai influenc when symptom of the diseas appear or how the diseas progress there ar a number of toxin that can caus parkinsonian symptom in human other still unidentifi environment factor also mai caus pd in genet suscept individu inflamm or overstimul of cell becaus of toxin or other factor mai plai a role in the diseas sever line of research suggest that mitochondria mai plai a role in the develop of pd mitochondria ar the energi produc compon of the cell and abnorm in the mitochondria ar major sourc of free radicalsmolecul that damag membran protein dna and other part of the cell thi damag i often refer to a oxid stress oxid stress relat chang includ free radic damag to dna protein and fat have been detect in brain of pd patient while mitochondri dysfunct oxid stress inflamm and mani other cellular process mai contribut to pd the actual initi caus of the dopamin cell death i still undetermin what gene ar link to parkinson s diseas sever gene have now been definit link to pd the first to be identifi wa alpha synuclein in the s research at nih and other institut studi the genet profil of a larg italian famili and three greek famili with famili pd and found that their diseas wa relat to a mutat in thi gene thei found a second alpha synuclein mutat in a german famili with pd these find prompt studi of the role of alpha synuclein in pd which led to the discoveri that lewi bodi abnorm mass of protein that develop insid nerv cell seen in sporad pd contain alpha synuclein protein thi discoveri reveal a potenti link between hereditari and sporad form of the diseas in research studi inherit pd discov that the diseas in on larg famili wa caus by a triplic of the normal alpha synuclein gene on copi of chromosom thi triplic caus peopl in the affect famili to produc too much of the normal alpha synuclein thi studi show that an excess of the normal form of the protein could result in pd just a the abnorm form doe other gene link to pd includ parkin dj pink and lrrk dj and pink caus rare earli onset form of pd the parkin gene i

which fatti acid oil wax and steroid accumul in the brain but differ chang in thi gene ar associ with an increas risk for parkinson diseas a well studi try to see what thi associ can tell u about parkinson risk in gener ar ongo who get parkinson s diseas about american ar diagnos with pd each year but get an accur count of the number of case i difficult becaus mani peopl in the earli stage of

no definit for the diseas peopl with pd mai sometim be told by their doctor that thei have other disord and peopl with pd like diseas mai be incorrectli diagnos a have pd pd affect about percent more men than women and the reason for thi discrep ar unclear while it occur in peopl throughout the world a number of studi have found a higher incid in develop countri other studi have found an increas risk in peopl who live in rural area and in those who work in certain profess although appar risk ar not fulli character on clear risk factor for pd i ag the averag ag of onset i year and the incid rise significantli with increas ag howev about to percent of peopl with pd have earli onset diseas that begin befor the ag of some earli onset case ar link to specif gene mutat such a parkin peopl

present there i no cure for pd but medic or surgeri can often provid improv in the motor symptom drug treatment medic for pd fall into three categori the first categori includ drug that increas the level of dopamin in the brain the most common drug for pd ar dopamin precursor substanc such a levodopa that cross the blood brain barrier and ar then chang into dopamin other drug mimic dopamin or prevent or slow it breakdown the second categori of pd drug affect other neurotransmitt in the bodi in order to eas some of the symptom of the diseas for exampl anticholinerg drug interfer with

that i the symptom that don t affect movem for exampl peopl with pd relat depress mai be prescrib antidepress levodopa the cornerston of therapi for pd i the drug levodopa also call l dopa nerv cell
