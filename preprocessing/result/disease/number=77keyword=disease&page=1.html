liver diseas sign symptom and diagnosi share home site map glossari faq canin epilepsi anti epilepsi drug a diet nutrition vaccin inform genet holist approach live with an epilept dog felin epilepsi dr dodd articl suggest read relat link liver diseas sign symptom and diagnosi column written by dr fleme sherwood anim clinic regina saskatchewan canada thi topic i a big a the state of alaska and texa combin i realli cannot do it justic in a short essai but i think it deserv some mention if onli to give the pet owner some understand a to the difficulti involv when a veterinarian i face with a case of possibl liver failur if you ask ten peopl the street what thei knew about liver i would bet that the onli consist answer you would get i that it tast realli bad unless the cook realli know hi stuff the best descript of the liver i can give you i that thi organ i the main industri centr of the bodi the liver process raw materi manufactur the build block of the bodi recycl the old to make new and detoxifi the industri wast of the bodi in short the liver i involv in just about everi biochem process requir to run e bodi a a result of thi relationship liver diseas can affect just about ani other part of the bodi and thu the symptom of liver diseas ar typic unpredict and non specif furthermor becaus the liver act a a biochem cross road for the bodi it i affect by a wide rang of diseas includ viral and bacteri infect degen and neoplast diseas and toxic insult it i estim that three per cent of all diseas seen by veterinarian i liver base the liver ha a doubl edg natur which while be life preserv make diagnos and treatment of liver diseas extrem difficult the liver ha a tremend reserv capac which mean that it can easili perform it s duti with up to to per cent of the liver mass affect by diseas while it certainli i a benefit that our liver can keep u aliv despit an overwhelm infect or a massiv tumour it also mean that the diseas i well advanc and possibl untreat befor ani symptom ar note we all know that diseas i most easili conquer earli but the veri natur of the liver make thi an imposs task on thing about liver though thei ar the onli organ in the bodi which i capabl of complet regener and thu i we do manag to successfulli treat the diseas there i a chanc of complet recoveri becaus of the complex of thi topic i am go to cover it us veri abbrevi point form i will try to skip over the experiment theori and the more esoter point and keep to the meat of the topic common present symptom all some or onli on of these sign mai be present intermitt recurr abdomin or gastrointestin upset loss of appetit vomit diarrhea constip progress depress or lethargi doe not want to plai anymor or refus to go for walk swollen belli with a fluid fill look thi i also known a ascit and i actual fluid accumul in the belli due to circul alter in the abdomen pale grai fece bile pigment ar what give poop it s characterist brown colour and if the liver i not process bile properli the fece will not get their colour orang urin the improp process of bile result in the excretion of bilirubin in the urin in high amount thu orang urin jaundic also known a icteru ani pale or white skin or visibl tissu take a yellow hue again the biliari pigment ar accumul in the bodi becaus the liver i not process them rare bleed problem mani of the protein requir for proper blood clot ar creat in the liver these protein and blood clot decreas hepat encephalopathi or sever neurolog sign behaviour chang seizur aimless pace or circl head press mai be associ with meal time pain associ with the abdomen thi i due to the stretch of the liver capsul mai be note when the dog i lift around the belli or when the veterinarian probe palpat the abdomen the veterinarian mai also notic a swollen liver while palpat with some of the more acut liver diseas chronic weight loss or wast the liver process all the build block if it fail to process the bodi fail to maintain itself increas water consumpt and urin most like due to dramat shift in serum and kidnei salt balanc mai be behaviour too point notabl symptom bile pigment process bile i a complex mixtur of organ and inorgan compound it i primarili respons for alkal the intestin content acid from the stomach emulsifi the dietari fat and prevent of putrefact of digest materi bilirubin on of the bile pigment i deriv from the break down of hemoglobin the oxygen carri molecul carri in our red blood cell bilirubin i quit toxic but it usual bind to a protein call albumin which harmlessli carri it to the liver for detoxif and excretion albumin i made in the liver liver failur result in poor bilirubin process and decreas albumin manufactur which result in a danger high level of free float bilirubin the liver excret the bilirubin after bind it to an amino acid into the bile duct system eventu the conjug bilirubin enter the digest tract where the intestin bacteria break it down to a harmless product call urobilinogen urobilinogen after complet digest in the intestin i brown therefor the fece tend to be brown jaundic also known a icteru result from the accumul of conjug and unconjug bilirubin in the bodi tissu thi becom visibl to the veterinarian especi around the white of the ey and the pale area of the gum import biolog function a hormon metabol the liver i both the target organ for mani of the bodi s hormon and the recycl centr for most of the hormon some of the symptom stem from liver failur mai mimic a major hormon imbal b vitamin metabol practic all the vitamin consum in our diet ar either directli involv in liver function or requir liver aid transform to be us in the bodi thi includ vitamin c the b vitamin vitamin a d e and k vitamin k i import to maintain blood clot and requir hepat transform from the inact form to the activ form c red blood cell mainten in the matur dog the liver plai an activ role in the remov of ag or damag red blood cell from circul it i also activ in the metabol of hemoglobin and the storag of iron abnorm in red blood cell structur i on of the harbing of liver diseas anemia mai be present in chronic liver diseas d hemostasi or blood clot abil most of the protein involv in the creation of a function blood clot ar made in the liver the clot system i an extrem complex interlock system some of the factor involv and you end up with a tendenc to ble or hemophilia e carbohydr and fat metabol sugar or carbohydr ar the basic fuel of the bodi the liver i the primari centr for process of the sugar into the form immedi requir the liver i also respons for the destruct of insulin the hormon directli involv with the cellular absorpt of blood sugar alter in liver function often do not affect blood sugar level until much of the liver ha been destroi fat metabol i extrem complex due to the vast number of function fat carri out in the bodi the liver sit at the centr of those mani function cholesterol i probabl the most common fat base product in the bodi be the major compon in the cell wall the basi for the steroid hormon and bile pigment and the precursor of vitamin d ani diseas in fat metabol can advers affect the liver and ani diseas in the liver can result in problem in fat metabol an exampl of thi i the fatti liver syndrom we see in cat wherea the rapid mobil of fat store dure starvat result in an overtax liver and eventu liver failur protein synthesi the liver manufactur mani of the protein involv in the bodi function the major protein i albumin which i requir for transport of mani nutrient and toxin i e bilirubin albumin i also respons for keep the serum concentr constant which i import with regard to serum fluid and salt balanc also known a oncot pressur also synthes in the liver i the globulin seri which ar respons for numer biochem reaction throughout the bodi elev of globulin mai indic a particular hepat pathologi the build block of protein ar the amino acid the liver i also primarili involv in process of dietari amino acid to modifi them into requir or us form some of the amino acid requir direct hepat metabol while other can be us by the bodi unchang experiment effort have been made to diagnos and track liver diseas base the rel proport of the variou amino acid to each other in liver failur the amino acid requir hepat alter prior to us should climb in concentr a compar to those amino acid unaffect by the liver import liver enzym tradition the medic practition ha measur the rel concentr of sever enzym which mai indic alter in liver health the follow enzym typic chang valu in the face of liver failur alanin aminotransferas alt liver specif in the dog and cat cell damag will caus elev of a lt due to leakag the elev of the enzym correl with the number of cell damag fall level of alt mai indic recoveri or mai indic a fail number of function liver cell rapid increas in alt mai indic an acut process while slow increas mai indic bile duct obstruct aspart aminotransferas ast an enzym seen in the liver heart kidnei skelet muscl and brain the half life of the ast in the blood stream i much shorter than that of alt therefor the valu of ast tend to drop more rapidli onc liver function i resum ast elev and alt elev should parallel each other in liver diseas alkalin phosphatas thi enzym i present in mani tissu therefor it i not veri specif in liver diseas but it appear veri earli in the progress of liver diseas therefor it i consid quit sensit alp tend to be slightli more specif in the cat but not quit a sensit a similar enzym or isoenzym i secret a a result of high level of cortison therefor an effort must be made to separ cortisol induc alp or calp and normal alp liver alp i releas from the liver when mani anticonvuls drug ar administ to the dog a similar sensit ha not been note in the cat thi must be taken into account when evalu alp level alp level typic ar greatli elev in the young grow anim and therefor a veterinarian should not mistak ani elev a diseas in a young anim gamma glutamyltransferas ggt thi enzym i ha it s highest concentr in the kidnei and pancrea but it i also found in the liver and other organ the major proport of ggt in the serum seem to come from the liver elev of ggt in diseas seem to stem from new synthesi rather than leakag therefor the chang seen due to diseas ar not spectacular larg elev of ggt ar more commonli associ with pancreat and bile duct obstruct bile acid these seri of organ acid circul almost entir in the local blood flow between the intestin and the liver a k a the portal system the flow i typic from the liver into the bile duct system then excretion into the intestin to aid digest after a meal to be re absorb into the portal system and recycl by the liver veri littl of the bile acid escap form the portal circul system into the rest of the bodi leakag i consid abnorm and i a sure sign of a liver abnorm thi i on of the most sensit test avail to diagnos liver diseas while the liver doe actual manufactur thi product it ha tremend reserv capac and can easili meet the bodi demand for bile acid despit sever diseas a a result of thi reserv the bile acid level do not typic drop due to liver diseas ammonia and urea ammonia i a by product of digest of protein in food and the catabol of nitrogen base organ materi in the bodi eighti per cent of ammonia i deliv to the liver and convert to urea in patient with liver insuffici the ammonia i not detoxifi to urea but enter the circul to act a a central nervou system depress in patient with a sever reduc liver function we mai see a true intoler of ammonia and thu neurolog sign after a heavi protein meal or we mai see substanti reduc urea level thi i a late sign in liver diseas onli seen after to per cent of the liver function i gone ascit develop thi i the accumul of fluid in the abdomin caviti and result from sever factor simpli put liver diseas tend to alter the blood pressur in the portal system the albumin and salt concentr in the serum the water retent in the bodi the function of the surround organ and the permeabl of the portal vessel a a result of all these factor fluid tend to build up in the abdomen and the anim get a big swollen fluid fill belli electrolyt and acid base disord common side effect of liver diseas due to a multipl of factor lead from metabol disord enough said gastrointestin ulcer and hemorrhag again a sequella to liver diseas which mai confus the veterinarian he mai think he i treat a simpl ulcer and miss the liver diseas hepat encephalopathi simpli describ a sever neurolog dysfunct due to advanc liver diseas ha been link to the accumul of biolog toxin includ ammonia alter in the blood brain barrier alter in the neuroreceptor in the brain and decreas blood sugar diagnosi of liver diseas have gone into such detail prior to thi i hope thi section will be short and to the point i hope most of my statem here will natur flow from point made abov examin specif note sign which mai indic
