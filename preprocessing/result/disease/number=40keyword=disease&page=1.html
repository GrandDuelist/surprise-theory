pass between episod between the acut attack most peopl ar free of symptom or note mild imbal and tinnitu ag at first visit to clinic menier s affect roughli of the popul here for more detail about the epidemiologi in our clinic practic where we care for larg number of menier s patient the most common ag of present i in the th decad thi probabl reflect the ag distribut of menier s in chicago illinoi which of cours i also a function of the ag of the popul in chicago it i a littl older than the typic ag of present of vestibular migrain which i in the th decad much older than the report highest preval ag for non vestibular migrain about and similar to the ag of present of bppv the ratio of women to men in our menier s popul i about menier s diseas usual start confin to on ear but it often extend to involv both ear over time so that after year of patient with menier s have bilater diseas stahl et al there i some controversi about thi statist howev some author for exampl silverstein suggest that the preval of bilater i a low a silverstein we suspect that thi lower statist i due to a lower durat of follow up and that the figur i more like to be correct other possibl howev ar select bia and differ pattern of the diseas in differ countri silverstein suggest that of person destin to becom bilater do so within year in most case a progress hear loss occur in the affect ear s a low frequenc sensorineur pattern i commonli found initi but a time goe it usual chang into either a flat loss or a peak pattern here for more inform about hear test although an acut attack can be incapacit the menier s diseas i not fatal what caus menier s diseas here for a more detail discuss figur a normal membran labyrinth b dilat membran labyrinth in menier s diseas hydrop the origin of menier s diseas i present controversi while in the past it wa felt that plumb problem hydrop in the ear were respons for the diseas the most current opinion i that hydrop ar ar just a marker for the menier s diseas rather than necessarili be respons for the symptom tradition think the origin of menier s diseas the most preval opinion i that an acut attack of menier s diseas result from fluctuat pressur of the fluid within the inner ear a system of membran call the membran labyrinth contain a fluid call endolymph the membran can becom dilat like a balloon when pressur increas thi i call hydrop on wai for thi to happen i when the drainag system call the endolymphat duct or sac i block in some case the endolymphat duct mai be obstruct by scar tissu a in delai endolymphat hydrop or mai be narrow from birth in some case there mai be too much fluid secret by the stria vasculari besid a stoppag of drainag pathwai abnorm enlarg fluid pathwai into the ear such a the vestibular aqueduct or cochlear aqueduct mai also be associ with menier s like symptom recent evid i against a relationship between the cochlear aqueduct and md yilmaz et al enlarg vestibular aqueduct ar on of the most commonli identifi inner ear boni malform in children with sensorineur hear loss of unknown caus oh et al the vestibular aqueduct extend from the medial wall of the vestibul to the posterior surfac of the petrou tempor bone most person with enlarg vestibular aqueduct with ear disord have hear loss but occasion there i an associ with vestibular problem shessel and nedzelski there mai be a genet link between enlarg vestibular aqueduct and pendr syndrom which i a congenit thyroid disord more recent thought the origin of menier s diseas the other hand hydrop i not found in all person with menier s diseas and hydrop i also commonli found autopsi studi of person who had no menier s type symptom honrubia rauch et al becaus menier s diseas occur in roughli person and hydrop i found in tempor bone there i more than an order of magnitud more peopl with hydrop than menier s diseas thu logic there must be someth more than simpli hydrop involv in the origin of menier s diseas see follow paragraph about immunolog function a well a autoimmun inner ear diseas recent attent ha also been focus the immunolog function of the endolymphat sac immun diseas mai contribut to a substanti percentag of menier s diseas we ourselv hold thi opinion base in part a studi in which patient with menier s diseas had a veri high preval about of autoimmun thyroid diseas brenner et al the other hand ruckenstein and other recent obtain a larg number of autoimmun blood test in a group of patient with unilater menier s diseas includ cbc ana anti sjoegren rf complem antiphospholipid antibodi western blot for heat shock protein mha syphili and lyme onli elev in the antiphospholipid antibodi were found of patient abov the expect anti heat shock protein wa found in thei conclud that it i unlik that autoimmun etiologi plai a signific role in their popul of unilater menier s ruckenstein anoth interpret of their data i that thei mai simpli not have had an appropri marker for autoimmun involv a well a unilater menier s mai have less autoimmun caus than bilater on can also build a reason case for migrain be the caus of some case of menier s diseas migrain about peopl i almost order of magnitud more common than menier s diseas about peopl and due to thi migrain variant with promin ear symptom ar more common than menier s diseas patient with menier s have migrain also about of the time menier s diseas hear loss doe not follow the expect pattern for an inner ear diseas i e loss of high frequenc first and loss of oae s non drug treatment of menier s i e diet i almost ident to migrain thu the bottom line i that in most patient with menier s diseas in the underli caus of menier s diseas i unknown it i most often attribut to viral infect of the inner ear head injuri a hereditari predisposit and allergi migrain mai caus symptom that overlap with menier s diseas or in some mai even be ident to menier s diseas at the level that we can resolv disord in the clinic i e without an autopsi here for more about the caus of menier s diseas what damag i done by menier s diseas hair cell death convent thought i that repeat attack of menier s kill hair cell in the inner ear thi i a gradual process over year but frequent result in unilater function deaf cochlear hear hair cell ar the most sensit vestibular hair cell seem more resili but there i also a slow declin in the calor respons in the diseas ear over roughli year stahl et al mechan chang to the ear mechan disrupt of the inner ear i also like with dilat of the utricl and saccul of the ear be a well known patholog find the saccul mai dilat so that in later stage it i adher to the undersid of the stape footplat thi mechan disrupt and distort of normal inner ear structur mai result in the gradual onset of a chronic unsteadi even when patient ar not have attack the period dilat and shrinkag of the utricl i also a reason explan for period attack of anoth inner ear disord bppv final it also seem like that there mai be ruptur of the suspensori system for the membran labyrinth thi might creat some mechan instabl of the utricl and saccul and consequ some chronic unsteadi some investig suggest that experiment menier s diseas kill the cochleovestibular nerv through neurotox in mice and guinea pig megarian et al howev the evid i against thi be the main mechan in human be see kitamura et al nadol et al rather it seem that menier s diseas damag both hair cell and nerv fiber in human studi of human ar handicap by the possibl that menier s i the final common pathwai of a varieti of ill of the ear how common i menier s diseas studi have shown that menier s diseas affect about out of peopl or in other word thi i roughli the same preval a multipl sclerosi m the major of peopl with menier s diseas ar over year of ag with equal distribut between male and femal interestingli the framingham studi found that peopl believ thei have menier s diseas in the u suggest that misdiagnosi i far more common than the correct diagnosi here for more i there a cure at the present time there i no cure for menier s diseas but there ar wai to manag the condition and help control symptom some recent refin treatment ar rather close to a cure i e low dose gentamicin while some have suggest that menier s mai burn out research studi suggest that thi i not like havia and kentala how doe the doctor know i have menier s diseas
