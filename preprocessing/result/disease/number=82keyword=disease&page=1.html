the most common inherit disord of the kidnei the phrase autosom domin mean that if on parent ha the diseas there i a percent chanc that the diseas gene will pass to a child in some casesperhap percentautosom domin pkd occur spontan in patient in these case neither of the parent carri a copi of the diseas gene mani peopl with autosom domin pkd live for sever decad without develop symptom for thi reason autosom domin pkd i often call adult polycyst kidnei diseas yet in some case cyst mai form earlier in life and grow quickli caus symptom in childhood the polycyst kidnei roughli retain the same shape a the healthi kidnei the cyst grow out of nephron the tini filter unit insid the kidnei the cyst eventu separ from the nephron and continu to enlarg the kidnei enlarg along with the cystswhich can number in the thousandswhil roughli retain their kidnei shape in fulli develop autosom domin pkd a cyst fill kidnei can weigh a much a to pound high blood pressur i common and develop in most patient by ag or what ar the symptom of autosom domin pkd the most common symptom ar pain in the and the sidesbetween the rib and hipsand headach the pain can be temporari or persist mild or sever peopl with autosom domin pkd also can experi the follow complic urinari tract infectionsspecif in the kidnei cyst hematuriablood in the urin liver and pancreat cyst abnorm heart valv high blood pressur kidnei stone aneurysmsbulg in the wall of blood vesselsin the brain diverticulosissmal pouch bulg outward through the colon how i autosom domin pkd diagnos autosom domin pkd i usual diagnos by kidnei imag studi the most common form of diagnost kidnei imag i ultrasound but more precis studi such a computer tomographi ct scan or magnet reson imag mri ar also wide us in autosom domin pkd the onset of kidnei damag and how quickli the diseas progress can vari kidnei imag find can also vari consider depend a patient s ag younger patient usual have both fewer and smaller cyst doctor have therefor develop specif criteria for diagnos the diseas with kidnei imag find depend patient ag for exampl the presenc of at least two cyst in each kidnei by ag in a patient with a famili histori of the diseas can confirm the diagnosi of autosom domin pkd if there i ani question about the diagnosi a famili histori of autosom domin pkd and cyst found in other organ make the diagnosi more like in most case of autosom domin pkd patient have no symptom and their physic condition appear normal for mani year so the diseas can go unnot physic checkup and blood and urin test mai not lead to earli diagnosi becaus of the slow undetect progress of cyst growth some peopl live for mani year without know thei have autosom domin pkd onc cyst have grown to about on half inch howev diagnosi i possibl with imag technologi ultrasound which pass sound wave through the bodi to creat a pictur of the kidnei i us most often ultrasound imag doe not us ani inject dye or radiat and i safe for all patient includ pregnant women it can also detect cyst in the kidnei of a fetu but larg cyst growth thi earli in life i uncommon in autosom domin pkd more power and expens imag procedur such a ct scan and mri also can detect cyst recent mri ha been us to measur kidnei and cyst volum and monitor kidnei and cyst growth which mai serv a a wai to track progress of the diseas an ultrasound imag devic pass harmless sound wave through the bodi to detect possibl kidnei cyst diagnosi can also be made with a genet that detect mutat in the autosom domin pkd gene call pkd and pkd although thi can detect the presenc of the autosom domin pkd mutat befor larg cyst develop it us i limit by two factor detect of a diseas gene cannot predict the onset of symptom or ultim sever of the diseas and if a diseas gene i detect no specif prevent or cure for the diseas exist howev a young person who know of a pkd gene mutat mai be abl to forestal the loss of kidnei function through diet and blood pressur control the genet mai also be us to determin whether a young member of a pkd famili can safe donat a kidnei to a famili member with the diseas individu with a famili histori of pkd who ar of childbear ag might also want to know whether thei have the potenti of pass a pkd gene to a child anyon consid genet test should receiv counsel to understand all the implic of the how i autosom domin pkd treat although a cure for autosom domin pkd i not avail treatment can eas symptom and prolong life pain pain in the area of the kidnei can be caus by cyst infect bleed into cyst kidnei stone or stretch of the fibrou tissu around the kidnei with cyst growth a doctor will first evalu which of these caus ar contribut to the pain to guid treatment if it i determin to be chronic pain due to cyst expans the doctor mai initi suggest over the counter pain medic such a aspirin or acetaminophen tylenol consult your doctor befor take ani over the counter medic becaus some mai be harm to the kidnei for most but not all case of sever pain due to cyst expans surgeri to shrink cyst can reliev pain in the and side howev surgeri provid onli temporari relief and doe not slow the diseas s progress toward kidnei failur headach that ar sever or that seem to feel differ from other headach might be caus by aneurysmsblood vessel that balloon out in spotsin the brain these aneurysm could ruptur which can have sever consequ headach also can be caus by high blood pressur peopl with autosom domin pkd should see a doctor if thei have sever or recur headacheseven befor consid over the counter pain medic urinari tract infect peopl with autosom domin pkd tend to have frequent urinari tract infect which can be treat with antibiot peopl with the diseas should seek treatment for urinari tract infect immedi becaus infect can spread from the urinari tract to the cyst in the kidnei cyst infect ar difficult to treat becaus mani antibiot do not penetr the cyst high blood pressur keep blood pressur under control can slow the effect of autosom domin pkd lifestyl chang and variou medic can lower high blood pressur patient should ask their doctor about such treatment sometim proper diet and exerc ar enough to keep blood pressur control end stage renal diseas after mani year pkd can caus the kidnei to fail becaus kidnei ar essenti for life peopl with esrd must seek on of two option for replac kidnei function dialysi or transplant in hemodialysi blood i circul into an extern filter where it i clean befor re enter the bodi in periton dialysi a fluid i introduc into the abdomen where it absorb wast and i then remov transplant of healthi kidnei into esrd patient ha becom a common and success procedur healthynon pkdkidnei transplant into pkd patient do not develop cyst top autosom recess pkd what i autosom recess pkd autosom recess pkd i caus by a mutat in the autosom recess pkd gene call pkhd other gene for the diseas might exist but have not yet been discov by scientist we all carri two copi of everi gene parent who do not have pkd can have a child with the diseas if both parent carri on copi of the abnorm gene and both pass that gene copi to their babi the chanc of the child have autosom recess pkd when both parent carri the abnorm gene i percent if onli on parent carri the abnorm gene the babi cannot get autosom recess pkd but could ultim pass the abnorm gene to hi or her children the sign of autosom recess pkd frequent begin befor birth so it i often call infantil pkd children born with autosom recess pkd often but not alwai develop kidnei failur befor reach adulthood sever of the diseas vari babi with the worst case die hour or dai after birth due to respiratori difficulti or respiratori failur some peopl with autosom recess pkd do not develop symptom until later in childhood or even adulthood liver scar occur in all patient with autosom recess pkd and tend to becom more of a medic concern with increas ag what ar the symptom of autosom recess pkd children with autosom recess pkd experi high blood pressur urinari tract infect and frequent urin the diseas usual affect the liver and spleen result in low blood cell count varicos vein and hemorrhoid becaus kidnei function i crucial for earli physic develop children with autosom recess pkd and decreas kidnei function ar usual smaller than averag size recent studi suggest that growth problem mai be a primari featur of autosom recess pkd how i autosom recess pkd diagnos ultrasound imag of the fetu or newborn reveal enlarg kidnei with an abnorm appear but larg cyst such a those in autosom domin pkd ar rare seen becaus autosom recess pkd tend to scar the liver ultrasound imag of the liver also aid in diagnosi how i autosom recess pkd treat medicin can control high blood pressur in autosom recess pkd and antibiot can control urinari tract infect eat increas amount of nutriti food improv growth in children with autosom recess pkd in some case growth hormon ar us in respons to kidnei failur autosom recess pkd patient must receiv dialysi or transplant if seriou liver diseas develop some peopl can undergo combin liver and kidnei transplant top genet diseas gene ar segment of dna the long molecul that resid in each of a person s cell the gene through complex process build protein for growth and mainten of the bodi at concept dnaor genesfrom both parent ar pass to the child a genet diseas occur when on or both parent pass abnorm gene to a child at concept if receiv an abnorm gene from just on parent i enough to produc a diseas in the child the diseas i said to have domin inherit if receiv abnorm gene from both parent i need to produc diseas in the child the diseas i said to be recess a genet diseas can also occur through a spontan mutat the chanc of acquir a domin diseas i higher than the chanc of acquir a recess diseas a child who receiv onli on gene copi for a recess diseas at concept will not develop the genet diseasesuch a autosom recess pkdbut could pass the gene to the follow gener top hope through research scientist have begun to identifi the process that trigger format of pkd cyst advanc in the field of genet have increas our understand of the abnorm gene respons for autosom domin and autosom recess pkd scientist have locat two gene associ with autosom domin pkd the first wa locat in chromosom and label pkd pkd wa local to chromosom in within year scientist had isol the protein these two gene produc polycystin and polycystin when both the pkd and pkd gene ar normal the protein thei produc work togeth to foster normal kidnei develop and inhibit cyst format a mutat in either of the gene can lead to cyst format but evid suggest that diseas develop also requir other factor in addition to the mutat in on of the pkd gene genet analys of most famili with pkd confirm mutat in either the pkd or pkd gene in about to percent of case howev famili with autosom domin pkd do not show obviou abnorm or mutat in the pkd and pkd gene us current test method research have also recent identifi the autosom recess pkd gene call pkhd chromosom genet test for autosom recess pkd to detect mutat in pkhd i now offer by a limit number of molecular genet diagnost laboratori in the unit state research have bred rodent with a genet diseas that parallel both inherit form of human pkd studi these mice will lead to greater understand of the genet and nongenet mechan involv in cyst format in recent year research have discov sever compound that appear to inhibit cyst format in mice with the pkd gene some of these compound ar in clinic test in human scientist hope further test will lead to safe and effect treatment for human with the diseas recent clinic studi of autosom domin pkd ar explor new imag method for track progress of cystic kidnei diseas these method us mri ar help scientist design better clinic trial for new treatment of autosom domin pkd peopl interest in particip in clinic trial of new treatment for pkd can find a list of center recruit patient at top point to rememb the two form of polycyst kidnei diseas pkd ar autosom domin pkd a form that usual caus symptom in adulthood autosom recess pkd a rare form that usual caus
