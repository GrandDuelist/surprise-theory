lyme diseas a lyme diseas primer the borrelia burgdorferi spirochet the agent of lyme diseas the deer tick ixod scapulari the main carrier of the borrelia burgdorferi while the infect we know todai a lyme diseas name for the connecticut town of lyme ha been around for at least a centuri public awar and confusion did not realli occur until the late s media exposur of thi infect virtual explod leav most of the gener public with some basic knowledg and a great deal of misconcept we hope to straighten out some of the myth surround at least the canin version of the lyme diseas infect human lyme diseas v canin lyme diseas erythema migran the characterist skin rash shown by human shortli after borrelia burgdorferi infect the first lesson to be learn about the lyme diseas infect i that it manifest complet differ in man�s best friend compar with the human experi after be bitten by a tick that ha transmit borrelia burgdorferi of human will develop a rash and flu like symptom in the next few week joint pain ensu with of peopl develop actual neurolog abnorm associ with lyme diseas and of peopl develop a heart rhythm disturb call a v block at thi same point in the infect timelin dog have yet to develop ani symptom at all week to month after infect about of peopl will experi intermitt arthriti attack and will develop chronic neurolog manifest in human lyme diseas present with the potenti for seriou long term ill in the dog ill mai never even occur when canin ill doe occur it doe not begin to manifest for week to month after infect at which point arthriti sign ar notic sometim there i a fever in dog heart and neurolog issu ar exceedingli rare plu the symptom of canin lyme diseas gener respond rapidli to an inexpens cours of proper antibiot see later for detail the borrelia burgdorferi organ i fairli well suit to live in the canin bodi without caus troubl most expos dog harbor the organ uneventfulli and never get sick still it i import not to discount lyme diseas in the dog complet lest on overlook an easili elimin caus of chronic joint diseas especi in dog of the northeast u s the dog�s the most seriou long term potenti regard glomerular diseas thi i a type of kidnei damag that occur when the immun system i stimul over a veri long time by a latent infecti organ or other immun stimulu thi i a much more insidi problem for which special test i need see later the tick and it control an organ that serv to transport and deliv an infecti organ from on host to anoth i call a vector the vector of lyme diseas in the northeast u s i the deer tick ixod scapulari the femal tick lai a clump of approxim egg in the spring a veri small six leg larva hatch and attach to a host a soon a it i abl sinc the larva i veri small it typic can onli reach a small host usual a white foot mous if the mous i carri the lyme diseas spirochet the larva can get infect at thi point three stage of the deer tick the larva bottom right nymph bottom left and adult femal top when the larva i full of blood it will drop off the host and lie dormant until the follow spring about a year later at thi point the larva molt and becom a nymph the nymph i a bit larger and mai anoth mous a host or mai approach larger game such a a dog or human the nymph fe dai and when it i full it drop off remain dormant until late summer it then molt into an adult tick when the nymph i feed it mai infect it host with the lyme spirochet if the nymph wa not alreadi infect from it larval stage it mai becom infect now dure it spring feed the adult tick seek a larger host henc it name the deer tick howev with man encroach upon the rang of the deer there ar often plenti of dog or human for the tick to attack the adult tick mate their new host fe and transmit the lyme spirochet if thei ar carri it the male tick remain attach through the winter but the femal onc engorg with the host�s blood drop off hide under leav and other debri through the winter and lai her egg in the spring for the two year cycl to begin again the feed tick i basic a blood sucker it must keep it host�s blood from clot in order to continu suck so it i abl to regurgit assort enzym to keep the blood flow liquid and smooth it i dure thi regurgit process that the lyme spirochet i brought up from the tick�s mid gut to it mouthpart thi process requir a minimum of hour which meansthat if the tick i remov within hour of attach the spirochet cannot be transmit and the host will not get the diseas tick control the host i an effect mean of infect prevent there ar sever effect tick control product avail includ the prevent collar advantix frontlin vectra d and promeri canin all of these product either kill the tick or caus it to drop off prior to the hour deadlin for a chart specifi and compar the detail of these tick prevent product here the west coast of the unit state there i far less lyme diseas than in the east although the northern coast of california i consid to have moder risk thi i becaus the lyme vector in these area i primarili ixod pacificu a tick that strongli prefer to fe reptil rather than mammal reptil blood ha natur anti borrelia factor which kill the lyme spirochet and prevent further transmiss the cdc center for diseas control provid a color code map of the u s indic risk there ar sever subspeci of borrelia burgdorferi in differ part of the world so lyme diseas i not uniqu to the unit state borrelia burgdorferi the spirochet and it detect the spirochet that caus lyme diseas cannot live outsid the bodi of a host it must live within either a mammal or a tick in the mammal�s bodi the spirochet i especi adept at bind to connect tissu if on i do addition read thi organ on will encount refer to the spirochete�s surfac protein call osp�s osp stand for outer surfac protein differ osp�s ar express depend whether the spirochet i attach to the tick midgut ospa the mammal�s connect tissu ospc or whether the tick i in an earli or late stage of mammal infect osp e and f respect by modifi it osp�s the spirochet i abl to chang it present to the mammalian host�s immun system thu escap immun destruct in addition to chang osp�s the spirochet can chang it shape into at least differ form and i abl to hide within cellular fold the lyme spirochet i a master of disguis and camouflag thi present an enorm diagnost challeng if the host�s immun system can�t even find the organ how ar we suppos to detect it antibodi level a dog with symptom of lyme diseas ideal should have a to confirm or rule out lyme diseas sinc it i almost imposs to cultur the lyme spirochet effort have center detect of antibodi against the osp�s here ar the problem encount with thi method in a lyme endem area a mani a of the dog will have antibodi against the lyme spirochet most expos dog never get sick but almost all of them will develop antibodi and these antibodi persist for year how do we tell the dog that have activ infect from those that have been expos and ar not sick from their exposur vaccin ha been avail for lyme diseas for a decad or more how do we distinguish antibodi gener by the vaccin from those gener by natur infect how do we distinguish antibodi gener by similar organ leptospira for exampl or harmless other borrelia speci the solution to these problem ha come about onli recent in the form of the c thi i an immunolog for antibodi against the c peptid a veri uniqu section of the on of the borrelia burgdorgeri surfac antigen a the spirochet chang it configur to escap the host�s immun system the c peptid remain constant and alwai detect vaccin doe not contain the c peptid so vaccin dog will not posit dog with other infect will not erron posit further thi i simpl enough to be avail a an in hous kit the idexx snap dx test or snap dx test which can be run in most veterinari hospit with result in approxim minut thi still doe not address distinguish activ infect from exposur dog will c posit within week of infect thei stai posit for over a year treatment and it goal which of these dog get sick and which on do not doe the dog with joint pain fever and a posit c ne medic thi i where the new i particularli good treatment of lyme diseas util a week cours of doxycyclin a medic which i inexpens and ha limit side effect potenti amoxicillin i anoth effect altern also inexpens and with minim side effect if lyme diseas i a consider mani veterinarian simpli prescrib the medic obviou improv i seen within hour further most tick born infect capabl of caus joint pain fever and sign similar to lyme diseas gener all share doxycyclin respons so a simpl cours of medic actual cover sever type of infect erad of the lyme spirochet i not a reason expect with treatment the organ i simpli too good at hide the goal instead i to bring the patient into what i call a premunit state thi i the state that of infect dog achiev when thei get infect but never get ill the organ i in their bodi latent but i not caus activ infect glomerular diseas some dog ar in fact harm by the long time presenc of an infecti organ in their bodi the immun system i constantli activ in it attempt to the invad spirochet and over the year these complex of antibodi mai deposit in the kidnei and caus damag it ha been recommend that dog with posit borrelia burgdorferi antibodi level be regularli screen for signific protein loss in their urin with a call a urin protein to creatinin ratio thi group of dog mai requir medic for their kidnei diseas for more inform glomerular diseas here recent an especi sensit ha been develop for the detect of minut quantiti of blood protein in the urin thi call the erd i so sensit that it us i not yet determin i e at what point i albumin loss in the kidnei signific and under what circumst might some albumin loss be normal and expect vaccin ye or no vaccin prevent infect in dog vaccin befor ani exposur to lyme spirochet thi mean it i onli help for dog not yet expos such a puppi and dog from non endem area travel to endem area annual booster continu the vaccin base immun there ar now three type of vaccin avail the kill whole spirochet vaccin fort dodge�s vaccin us intact dead spirochet inject into the host by us the entir spirochet the host i expos to part of the organ that ar not us in immun and mai lead to vaccin reaction the next type of vaccin i felt to be superior in prevent reaction and that i the recombin vaccin merial�s vaccin thi vaccin gener antibodi specif against ospa the surfac protein the spirochet us to attach to it tick host when the tick bite and suck blood full of anti ospa antibodi the spirochete�s migrat sequenc i block and the spirochet i prevent from even exit the tick the vaccin util dna for ospa clone into a harmless viru so that the entir lyme spirochet i not us onli the ospa dna i us the third type of vaccin intervet schere plough s vaccin target a protein call ospc a well a the surfac protein ospa the idea i that the ospc antibodi kill ani borrelia that have not been de activ by the ospa antibodi provid enhanc protect vaccin against the lyme organ remain controversi we will present both side of the argum and the pet owner can decid if thei want to includ vaccin in their lyme prevent effort argum against vaccin lyme diseas in the dog i an infect for which over of infect dog will never get sick and the that do get sick can be easili treat with a safe inexpens cours of antibiot thi situat would seem to indic that vaccin i simpli not worth the expens a for the kidnei diseas that can occur in some individu with long term antigen exposur we do not know what borrelia antigen ar involv in the immun stimul that caus thi condition it might be that the same antigen us in the vaccin ar involv in which case vaccin might be just a hazard a actual infect even ospa the same antigen of the recombin vaccin ha been implic in chronic human diseas argum for vaccin we vaccin ourselv for the flu an infect that i for most peopl more of a nuisanc than alif threaten event and think noth of it vaccin i about prevent of infect just becaus an ill i not life threaten doe not mean that we should not prevent it with vaccin further in anon endem area lyme diseas i not go to be a caus of arthriti that most veterinarian will consid treatment i onli simpl if on think to perform the treatment but in an area where there i veri littl lyme diseas thi treatment mai easili be omit why not just prevent the infect outright from the begin if the dog i go to travel to a tick endem area if we allow our dog to readili becom infect with the lyme organ do thei not becom a potenti sourc for human infect through their tick we try to minim the deer and mice in our vicin but we want to keep compani with the famili dog but who want a reservoir of lyme spirochet in their home a for the kidnei diseas we do not know what spirochet antigen ar implic in thi condition the recombin vaccin expos the patient onli to on spirochet antigen ospa and prevent the introduct of the spirochet into the mammal�s bodi vaccin at least with the recombin vaccin mai be prevent to thi syndrom again when it come to prevent there i noth controversi about tick control it i crucial in lyme endem area to us tick control product lyme diseas i a region problem for more guidanc regard thi infect in your area or area where you will be travel see your veterinarian last updat
