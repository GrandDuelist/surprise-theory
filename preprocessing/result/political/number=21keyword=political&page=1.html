i by natur a social anim an individu who i unsoci natur and not accident i either beneath our notic or more than human societi i someth that preced the individu anyon who either cannot lead the common life or i so self suffici a not to ne to and therefor doe not partak of societi i either a beast or a god that wa said almost year ago by aristotl religion continu the emphasi social respons over the follow millennia christian ha the parabl of the good samaritan and the golden rule from jesu sai so whatev you wish that other would do to you do also to them for thi i the law and the prophet that i the word in the modern english standard bibl islam also emphas commun and in fact the foundat of islam were base reform societi it also emphas public or commun worship and it ha a strong emphasi the social respons to stop your brother from do wrong in the western tradition that began chang in the s with the philosophi of hobb and lock place more emphasi the self interest individu although lock unlik hobb still believ human were social anim but drew a clear line between civil societi and the state societi creat order and grant the state legitimaci and the state provid imparti justic and the imparti protect of properti lock i consid the father of liber while hobb argu that human in a state of natur were constantli at war and life wa nasti brutish and short lock saw that state of natur a peac becaus individu had a duti to respect the right of other thi wa a natur moral duti more recent writer like hayek and particularli ayn rand took individu self interest further ayn rand went so far a to suggest that the individu ha no natur duti to societi summar a follow we onli have on life and the good i to live it learn to pursu your own happi by discov the life promot valu it requir think ration and dont bow to author join with other peopl when you have real valu in common and go your separ wai when you dont dont try to be your brother keeper or to forc him to be your live independ to me it seem that these more recent approach have come to domin our social and econom think with greater emphasi individu right and less the social duti to respect the right of other the modern neo liber economist certainli see littl or no role for govern in their perfect world the individu i free to pursu their own end in accord with the john stuart mill maxim that the onli freedom which deserv the name i that of pursu our own good in our own wai but thei tend to ignor the proviso in mill statem so long a we do not attempt to depriv other of their or imped their effort to attain it in realiti mill maxim balanc individu and social respons by state that an individu freedom cannot come at the expens of other freedom lock natur moral duti to respect the right of other when we take account of other in exerc our freedom and make our person decision and choic we ar exerc social respons but there ar also social respons that ar or should be commun in our modern societi those respons ar often taken by govern in the interest of the commun a a whole in reject a social elem in econom economist refer to the tragedi of the common to justifi that individu ownership that i privat properti i superior to common or social ownership although the idea ha a longer histori the phrase came from a paper by garrett hardin in it wa suggest that when peopl graze their herd a common a self interest individu could improv hi situat by ad on anim to hi herd the individu would gain the benefit but if each individu add on anim or two the common i quickli degrad while the individu retain the benefit of have an extra anim the cost the degrad i share leav them with a self interest benefit befor the failur of the system follow thi argum and it corollari that adam smith benevol invis hand of individu self interest doe not work for the common economist suggest that privat properti and the individu respons for that properti remedi the situat that approach i base howev a misunderstand of how common work thei were not access a the theori impli throughout the world where peopl share resourc there were usual social and cultur rule that control that share in iceland for exampl the common resourc of the fisheri wa tradition control by kinship rule that alloc space the beach that were necessari for launch fish boat in some commun in india the alloc of the common resourc of water for farm wa determin by commun meet peopl accept these approach a essenti for the well be of their commun or in other word were accept social respons hardin put the tragedi of the common in the context of popul pressur and i accept that popul pressur i a factor but not necessarili in the wai hardin interpret it it i sometim popul pressur that will forc peopl to leav a commun and enter the market economi becaus the social rule prevent them have full access to the common it i often their return even mere for a visit with new idea of individu respons self interest and privat properti that the declin of social oblig for the mainten of the common acceler it wa the breakdown of social respons of local rule and oblig that chang the us of the common and that itself aros from the introduct and growth of the market with it emphasi individu self interest that can be seen in recent histori in develop countri a some peopl abandon the local rule to particip in the market the cost in econom term of maintain social oblig rise and no longer provid the greatest benefit hasten the break down of social respons rule of reciproc which were common in mani societi and reinforc social oblig also came under pressur from the influenc of the market and the concept of privat properti in our own societi the health system provid an exampl of the role of individu and social respons a healthi popul i among other thing in the econom interest of a commun or societi provid a healthi labour forc and reduc cost in care for the sick cost in thi context includ time spent care for the ill which mai mean two peopl withdraw from the labour forc the carer and the care for while an individu choic can affect their health smoke over eat not exerc and therefor there i a case for individu respons there ar mani other environment and genet factor that contribut to diseas over which the self interest individu ha no control social respons i taken by govern to the extent that it attempt to control those extern factor by for exampl pollution control food and drug safeti diseas surveil occup health and safeti and even urban plan that allow for healthi environ includ access to exerc amen park walk track and so the neo liber would not agre with some of these thei ar more like to stress that the valu an individu put their health i reflect in the price thei ar will to pai henc the growth of privat fee pai gymnasium let alon privat health care stress the right of the individu over the health of the commun can have seriou implic in the case of major ill we gener accept that individu even neighbourhood or whole commun mai ne to be quarantin a in the current ebola outbreak in africa or an outbreak of bubon plagu in sydnei in when mani block in and surround the current cbd were quarantin then clean and peopl move into camp thi i a clear case of social respons over ride individu right but im not sure how the neo liber would deal with it philosoph there i also a tension between individu and social respons even with minor ill if i have a cold or influenza should i exerc my right to earn a live and go to work or should i stai at home and not spread the ill to other if i spread my ill am i impact the right of other to earn their live it can be argu that paid sick dai for employe i a social respons wai of deal with thi you would think that provid health care would be a public good to be provid by govern a a social respons but that i not necessarili so when on read the econom definit of a public good the economist usual consid that the market ha respons for the effici alloc of resourc and govern the respons for public good thi i the econom separ of respons economist defin public good neg in the sens that thei ar basic good the market cannot provid at a profit no concept at all that there mai be a social respons or a social benefit in govern provid certain good and servic irrespect of the market for an economist a public good must be non exclud and non rivalr the first mean that it i not possibl or not cost effici to exclud peopl from benefit by the provision of the good firework displai ar a simpl exampl i could set up a fire work displai and attempt to charg peopl to attend but peopl could easili watch from a short distanc awai possibl even from their own nearbi home unless i set up a larg exclusion area and that mai not be feasibl or mai be too costli the second non rivalr mean that the consumpt of the good by on person doe not preclud it also be us by anoth if i watch the firework that doe not stop other peopl from watch or my us of a park doe not stop other from us it i have seen sewerag system list a public good but it would theoret be possibl to have a system where peopl could be exclud by disconnect them a can happen with electr but that could have wider health implic that could not be restrict to the individu concern the veri reason sewer were first construct so there i a social respons health aspect not non exclud in ensur that all peopl remain connect to the sewerag system but that social respons i miss from the economist definit the market i not in interest in public good a defin abov becaus non exclud creat the free rider effect that i someon can benefit without pai the person watch the firework from their own window the market place more emphasi non exclud than non rivalr so supplier in the market will happili creat a price for non rivalr good but wont becom involv in non exclud good in thi context sport event and cinema can be consid non rivalr mani peopl can us the product at the same time but thei ar exclud on person or can be allow into a sport event it just depend make a profit despit that the neo liber approach ha seen more and more good and servic move from the public to the privat domain blur the separ of econom respons that also move decision make right regard the good or servic from on agent to anoth and involv or should a shift of the associ respons so if former public servic ar now provid by the market should the firm in the market also bear the social respons that goe with them the neo liber economist claim that minim social respons should be born by the market us adam smith invis hand to justifi that self interest ha social benefit corpor social respons i a signific issu it rose to promin in the s and s but had almost disappear by the late s it i make a comeback but the predomin econom philosophi remain that the duti of a ceo and a board i to maxim return to the owner of a firm the sharehold it i argu that social respons conflict with the duti to maxim return and also cannot readili be measur so there i littl point in insist that it should be part of a firm oblig there i howev an altern argum that be a good corpor citizen i in the long term interest of a compani and the valu it i abl to return to it sharehold unless a compani i intent maxim earn and profit in the short term and then fold a some obvious do a compani abl to sustain it earn into the futur doe requir some accept of social respons and good corpor citizenship it i when thei realis that their imag i import for sale that these issu mai rise to the fore for current common like the earth atmospher and ocean economist argu that a degre of ownership i requir to stop degrad such a trade system for reduc co emiss or tradeabl quota for fishermen not that the problem can or should be remedi by govern regul but if govern in a democraci i repres the will of the peopl then it mai have a social respons to maintain the common for the peopl irrespect of the market the un i close to that view in relat to co and climat chang but not the current australian govern what have compani been do for over two centuri but free ride the rest of u by pour their wast into the common of the atmospher ocean and river it i becaus the market ha rob the peopl of their control of the common that privat agent can exploit it and also becaus mani firm follow the neo liber econom agenda dont accept thei have a social respons neither gener nor in relat to the common the neo liber ignor that peopl do not alwai act in their own self interest social relationship and cultur valu social inclus can mould decision these also shape our social respons we support our neighbour in time of troubl dure flood and fire ordinari peopl will run into a burn build to save someon thei dont know peopl stop at road accid to help if thei can peopl will care for a lost child until a parent turn up and so and so despit what the neo liber think social respons still exist in the heart of the peopl and we ar still a social anim a infant we learn to be human in a social context through the other that surround u we should be demand greater social respons not just the promotion of individu self interest from compani and from govern will we ever get social respons from our current govern of cours not a it i too easi to see which side of the fenc it fall in thi debat what do you think tp m@il creat your own email faq
