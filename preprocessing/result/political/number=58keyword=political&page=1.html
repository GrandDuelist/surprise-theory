empir approach you can learn more about write for polit theori class in the section write in polit theori below build theoriessinc theori build serv a the cornerston of the disciplin it mai be us to see how it work you mai be wrestl with theori or propos your own a you write your paper consid how polit scientist have arriv at the theori you ar read and discuss in your cours most polit scientist adher to a simpl model of scientif inquiri when build theori the kei to build precis and persuas theori i to develop and hypothes hypothes ar statem that research construct for the purpos of test whether or not a certain relationship exist between two phenomena to see how polit scientist us hypothes and to imagin how you might us a hypothesi to develop a thesi for your paper consid the follow exampl suppos that we want to know whether presidenti elect ar affect by econom condition we could formul thi question into the follow hypothesi when the nation unemploy rate i greater than percent at the time of the elect presidenti incumb ar not reelect collect datain the research model design to thi hypothesi the depend variabl the phenomenon that i affect by other variabl would be the reelect of incumb presid the independ variabl the phenomenon that mai have some effect the depend variabl would be the nation unemploy rate you could the relationship between the independ and depend variabl by collect data unemploy rate and the reelect of incumb presid and compar the two set of inform if you found that in everi instanc that the nation unemploy rate wa greater than percent at the time of a presidenti elect the incumb lost you would have signific support for our hypothesi howev research in polit scienc seldom yield immedi conclus result in thi case for exampl although in most recent presidenti elect our hypothesi hold true presid franklin roosevelt wa reelect in despit the fact that the nation unemploy rate wa to explain thi import except and to make certain that other factor besid high unemploy rate were not primarili respons for the defeat of incumb presid in other elect year you would ne to do further research so you can see how polit scientist us the scientif method to build ever more precis and persuas theori and how you might begin to think about the topic that interest you a you write your paper clear consist object writingsinc polit scientist construct and assess theori in accord with the principl of the scientif method write in the field convei the rigor object and logic consist that character thi method thu polit scientist avoid the us of impressionist or metaphor languag or languag which appeal primarili to our sens emotion or moral belief in other word rather than persuad you with the eleg of their prose or the moral virtu of their belief polit scientist persuad through their command of the fact and their abil to relat those fact to theori that can withstand the of empir investig in write of thi sort clariti and concision ar at a premium to achiev such clariti and concision polit scientist precis defin ani term or concept that ar import to the argum that thei make thi precision often requir that thei operation kei term or concept operation simpli mean that important—but possibl vagu or abstract—concepts like justic ar defin in wai that allow them to be measur or test through scientif investig fortun you will gener not be expect to devis or operation kei concept entir your own in most case your professor or the author of assign read will alreadi have defin and or operation concept that ar import to your research and in the event that someon hasnt alreadi come up with precis the definit you ne other polit scientist will in all likelihood have written enough the topic that your investig to give you some clear guidanc how to proce for thi reason it i alwai a good idea to explor what research ha alreadi been done your topic befor you begin to construct your own argum see our handout make an academ argum exampl of an operation termto give you an exampl of the kind of rigor and object polit scientist aim for in their write let examin how someon might operation a term read through thi exampl should clarifi the level of analysi and precision that you will be expect to emploi in your write here how you might defin kei concept in a wai that allow u to measur them we ar all familiar with the term democraci if you were ask to defin thi term you might make a statem like the follow democraci i govern by the peopl you would of cours be correct—democracy i govern by the peopl but in order to evalu whether or not a particular govern i fulli democrat or i more or less democrat when compar with other govern we would ne to have more precis criteria with which to measur or assess democraci most polit scientist agre that these criteria should includ the follow right and freedom for citizen freedom to form and join organizationsfreedom of expressionright to voteelig for public officeright of polit leader to compet for supportright of polit leader to compet for votesaltern sourc of informationfre and fair electionsinstitut for make govern polici depend vote and other express of preferencebi adopt these nine criteria we now have a definit that will allow u to measur democraci thu if you want to determin whether brazil i more democrat than sweden you can evalu each countri in term of the degre to which it fulfil the abov criteria what count a good write in polit scienc while rigor clariti and concision will be valu in ani piec of write in polit scienc know the kind of write task youv been assign will help you to write a good paper two of the most common kind of write assign in polit scienc ar the research paper and the theori paper write polit scienc research papersyour instructor us research paper assign a a mean of assess your abil to understand a complex problem in the field to develop a perspect thi problem and to make a persuas argum in favor of your perspect in order for you to successfulli meet thi challeng your research paper should includ the follow compon an introduct a problem statem a discuss of methodologi a literatur review a descript and evalu of your research find and a summari of your find here a brief descript of each compon in the introduct of your research paper you ne to give the reader some basic background inform your topic that suggest why the question you ar investig i interest and import you will also ne to provid the reader with a statem of the research problem you ar attempt to address and a basic outlin of your paper a a whole the problem statem present not onli the gener research problem you will address but also the hypothes that you will consid in the methodologi section you will explain to the reader the research method you us to investig your research topic and to the hypothes that you have formul for exampl did you conduct interview us statist analysi reli upon previou research studi or some combin of all of these methodolog approach befor you can develop each of the abov compon of your research paper you will ne to conduct a literatur review a literatur review involv read and analyz what other research have written your topic befor go to do research of your own there ar some veri pragmat reason for do thi work first a insight a your idea mai be someon els mai have had similar idea and have alreadi done research to them by read what thei have written your topic you can that you dont but rather learn from work that ha alreadi been done second to demonstr the sound of your hypothes and methodologi you will ne to indic how you have borrow from and or improv upon the idea of other by refer to what other research have found your topic you will have establish a frame of refer that enabl the reader to understand the full signific of your research result thu onc you have conduct your literatur review you will be in a position to present your research find in present these find you will ne to refer to your origin hypothes and explain the manner and degre to which your result fit with what you anticip you would find if you see strong support for your argum or perhap some unexpect result that your origin hypothes cannot account for thi section i the place to convei such import inform to your reader at thi point you should also suggest further line of research that will help refin clarifi inconsist with or provid addition support for your hypothes final in the summari section of your paper you should reiter the signific of your research and your research find and specul upon the path that futur research effort should take write in polit theorypolit theori differ from other subfield in polit scienc in that it deal primarili with histor and norm rather than empir analysi in other word polit theorist ar less concern with the scientif measur of polit phenomena than with understand how import polit idea develop over time and thei ar less concern with evalu how thing ar than in debat how thei should be a return to our democraci exampl will make these distinct clearer and give you some clue about how to write well in polit theori earlier we talk about how to defin democraci empir so that it can be measur and test in accord with scientif principl polit theorist also defin democraci but thei us a differ standard of measur their definit of democraci reflect their interest in polit ideals—for exampl liberti equal and citizenship—rather than scientif measur so when write about democraci from the perspect of a polit theorist you mai be ask to make an argum about the proper wai to defin citizenship in a democrat societi should citizen of a democrat societi be expect to engag in decision make and administr of govern or should thei be satisfi with cast vote everi coupl of year in order to substanti your position such question you will ne to pai special attent to two interrel compon of your write the logic consist of your idea and the manner in which you us the argum of other theorist to support your own first you ne to make sure that your conclusion and all point lead up to it follow from your origin premis or assumpt if for exampl you argu that democraci i a system of govern through which citizen develop their full capac a human be then your notion of citizenship will somehow ne to support thi broad definit of democraci a narrow view of citizenship base exclus or primarili vote probabl will not do whatev you argu howev you will ne to be sure to demonstr in your analysi that you have consid the argum of other theorist who have written about these issu in some case their argum will provid support for your own in other thei will rais critic and concern that you will ne to address if you ar go to make a convinc case for your point of
