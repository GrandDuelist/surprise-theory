doe thi when he count submiss to a conqueror ascons but lock also run thi risk when he state in ofth second treatis that the veri be of anyonewithin the territori of a govern amount to tacitcons final it i not clear that consent i realli the kei topolit oblig in these theori the upshot of hobb s theoryseem to be that we have an oblig to obei anyon who can maintainord and in lock s it seem that there ar some thing to which wecannot consent in particular we cannot consent to place ourselvesund an absolut ruler for do so would defeat the veri purposesfor which we enter the social contract to
