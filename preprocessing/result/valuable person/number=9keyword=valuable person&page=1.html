valuabl person jim harbaugh s work with the er ha made him the hottest properti in the game ye rg even hotter than you by bill barnwel decemb the most valuabl asset in the nfl i have a franchis quarterback sign for a rel pittanc it no accid that the trade valu list i put togeth in august wa litter with quarterback within the top if andrew luck hit the free market thi past offseason without be draft a quarterback desper team like the brown or jaguar would have given him million in guarante monei in a heartbeat but the leagu cba restrict him to million over four year that save just under million i for the colt to spend howev thei like a reward for have an aw season at exactli the right time isnt footbal fun after i put togeth the midseason updat to the trade valu rank i start to get the feel like i wa miss someth there i on other asset a team can hold that actual remark similar to the cheap talent young quarterback a head coach and when i thought about great head coach natur my mind turn to jim harbaugh the er sign jim harbaugh awai from stanford for a pittanc hi buyout figur hasnt been publicli report but if there wa on it like wasnt more than a coupl million buck san francisco gave harbaugh a five year million deal to replac mike singletari and take over a franchis that had gone sinc steve mariucci left town sinc then with virtual the same roster harbaugh inherit the er have gone and made it within a prematur whistl of make the super bowl it the best decision a franchis ha made of their own volition e g without have an obviou choic fall into their lap in recent memori by acquir harbaugh the er creat valu for themselv in a wai that i virtual imposs to match thei might in fact have the singl most valuabl asset in all of footbal let put that contract into perspect for a minut jim harbaugh i make million per season to be arguabl the best person in the leagu at hi exceedingli import position you know panther defens end charl johnson mayb the th best end in the leagu he receiv million in compens in alon that more than harbaugh will receiv over the life of hi entir deal with million left over for johnson to write thank you note to marti hurnei a top five head coach i be paid what an averag cornerback would make in a given year doesnt that seem wrong the weird thing i that we know inher that team valu coach much higher than that when bill belichick quit hi job a head coach of the jet and announc that he wa join the patriot instead new england end up give the jet a first round pick for belichick servic and rememb that wa belichick when he wa popularli known a bill parcellss top assist who had put togeth a disappoint run in cleveland not the bill belichick we know todai a top coach i worth even more when the buccan decid that thei want to take jon gruden awai from the raider the cost wa astronom tampa bai gave oakland two first round pick two second round pick and an million transfer fee to get their man of cours the buccan didnt regret it thei went to the super bowl the follow season where thei beat those veri same raider if a team realli want to acquir harbaugh todai the price would probabl be roughli similar to the figur the raider quot for gruden who had taken over a team and gone in four season without advanc past the afc championship game how mani player in the leagu would extract a similar bounti in trade talk when the redskin acquir the second overal pick in thi year draft from the ram to grab robert griffin iii thei gave up a somewhat similar packag the sixth overal pick and a second rounder in the draft plu first round pick in and the bear grab jai cutler from the bronco for two first round pick a third rounder and kyle orton the sort of trade valu a top coach would appear to have i roughli similar to that of a young franchis quarterback which lead me to believ that the leagu valu harbaugh a an asset somewher in the rang between rg and cutler i lump them both togeth in the draft valu piec but griffin no lower than the fifth most valuabl player in the leagu right now and cutler no lower than th let consid what player in that rang ar paid while griffin i be paid a pittanc million over four year becaus the leagu doesnt allow him to negoti the free market there ar plenti of veteran in that rang who have sign contract that pai them someth close to market valu the quarterback in that area who sign a deal most recent i drew bree and when the saint lock him thi offseason thei gave bree a deal that pai him million per year and million in the first year of the contract befor that michael vick sign a six year million deal with the eagl that guarante him million while pai him around million or so over it first three year harbaugh deal i entir guarante but even if we compar it to the first three year of deal be sign by player in hi trade valu rang harbaugh i underpaid by somewher between million and million per season outsid of luck and griffin and mayb cam newton and russel wilson that make him the most underpaid asset in the leagu if harbaugh stai thi good over the cours of hi five year deal and doesnt rip up the contract at ani point the niner ar recoup someth to the effect of million to million in valu over the cours of harbaugh deal when your build a billion stadium save million sure come in handi of cours there ar some assumpt be made here notabl while the er undoubtedli hope that thei were get the best coach in footbal when thei sign harbaugh awai from stanford there wa no guarante that thei were get a truli great coach the leagu i litter with brilliant colleg coach who were sent pack to the amateur rank when harbaugh sign hi next deal it will undoubtedli be for more monei but the truth i that the deal realli wont be for all that much more although belichick exact level of compens remain a state secret forb estim it at million which would narrowli make belichick the highest paid coach in the leagu over mike shanahan million when harbaugh sign hi next deal how much more than those coach will he realli get million per year million that a bargain when you consid that the next contract andrew luck will sign could take hi million salari and tripl it to million while throw in a sign bonu around million the salari ceil for head coach i almost absurdli low given their valu what make that fact even more bizarr i that coach salari ar uncap if your a derang billionair hell bent win a dozen super bowl you cant be manchest citi and bui the biggest star from each nfl team you cant whisper million per year into aaron rodgerss agent ear and wait for him to hit the market hell be franchis and even if you gave him that much you wouldnt be abl to build a team around him what you can do though i spend a much monei a you want in place where the leagu doesnt have a salari cap you can build the best practic facil the planet and emul everi possibl set of weather and crowd condition you can invest million into develop fantast medic facil and hire great doctor and shave time off your injur player rehab and ye you can whisper million per year into jim harbaugh agent ear and if harbaugh doesnt want to re sign with the niner thei cant franchis him and you dont have ani monei come off of your cap space it a place where a team with deep pocket can gain a competit advantag in a wai that thei simpli cant by spend player there ar other advantag to invest heavili in a top of the line coach a oppos to a similarli valu player coach ar far less like to rock the boat thei dont hold out and can serv a an effect voic of reason in dissemin the parti line the organ want to put out while a good quarterback can help bring a young team along just wit peyton man work with the denver offens thi year a coach i further abl to impact player develop by both select the appropri player to us and then nurtur them into superior talent becaus coach arent reli fast twitch muscl fiber their peak last much longer thei dont appear to slump although i suppos you can make an argum that it possibl coach ar also extrem unlik to suffer injuri and ar almost alwai present and account for across the entir game slate that not true for player coach arent without their disadvantag either while the cumul career of an elit coach i almost alwai longer than a similarli skill quarterback the coach i like to have a shorter career in on particular spot than a player especi at the profession level smart team take advantag of what thei know about the ag curv by pai younger player for their peak year and avoid big salari rapidli ag talent that past it prime but that a harder act in evalu and sign coach becaus coach ar older and have longer career theyr also more like to be set in their wai and us outdat antiqu method than a top player in hi prime would be there ar also some financi burden coach get guarante contract and when you fire your head coach chanc ar that you have to let most of hi assist go too you can cut a player without need to get rid of everybodi around him in all though i think it pretti clear that harbaugh and elit coach of hi ilk ar vastli underpaid and respons for produc huge amount of valu for their respect organ even if you dont valu harbaugh at the level of a player like rg it pretti clear that hi trade valu i commensur with that of a player who would make somewher around three time hi salari in a given year on dai an enterpr owner who sick of lose i go to realiz that and snap up harbaugh or bill belichick by promis them million a year when their contract expir until then harbaugh go to have to ply hi trade a on of the leagu most undervalu asset a previou version of thi stori incorrectli list jim harbaugh record a we apolog for the ye the niner did draft aldon smith under harbaugh but the possibl exist that harbaugh influenc that pick rememb that singletari i commonli slap with the blame for take taylor mai with san francisco second round pick in a move that wa derid a the season went along and eventu result in mai be trade to the bengal for penni the dollar san francisco also sign carlo roger and dont whitner to shore up the secondari but those gui have plai better in san francisco than thei did in their old local and previou veteran free agent like nate clement fail to impress dure their time by the bai let give the organ some credit for the talent thei had the readi for harbaugh but it seem extrem clear that he gotten far more out of the player the roster than hi predecessor did with those pick and the assort trade that result from them the raider end up select phillip buchanon langston walker tyler brayton and jake grove not exactli a fantast haul but if the raider had scout draft and develop better thei could have us those same pick other player taken a few spot after oakland actual select and end up nab ed re antwaan randl el charl tillman and justin smilei gruden last game with the raider wa the tuck rule snow game loss to the patriot in the playoff you cant realli blame him for think that fate wa against him win a super bowl with oakland after that on on team who recogn thi but didnt have it work out all that well would be the philadelphia eagl who did thi a smaller scale by go out and hire the best assist coach in the leagu to work underneath andi reid thei went out and sign legendari position coach like howard mudd offens line bobbi april special team and jim washburn defens line pai them a premium without have it come off of their cap room the result were mix mudd did pretti solid work with a line that wa often riddl with injuri but april special team unit have been pretti averag and washburn wa such a person problem that the team fire him last week thi i a year in which unfortun that hasnt been the case colt head coach chuck pagano i fight leukemia and harbaugh wa taken to the hospit in novemb and treat for an irregular heartbeat nfl player ar also suscept to these unexpect injuri though and obvious ar far more like to suffer contact or motion injuri than coach and even if a coach doe suffer a torn acl and broken leg a sean payton did last year he can still coach facebook twitter print e mail share file under jim harbaugh nfl peopl
