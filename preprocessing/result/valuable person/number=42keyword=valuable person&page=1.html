forum to articl print email share share i peopl your most valuabl resourc by christer idhammar peopl ar our most valuabl resourc i most probabl the correct polit statem to make but i thi true i do not think it i not true and in thi articl i will explain why i think so in hi book good to great jim collin talk about have the right peopl the bu befor you a journei toward excel those of you who have read hi book will recogn some of my reason here dure the last five month i have ask front line leader in mainten organ all over the world includ australia new zealand canada usa sweden and unit kingdom the follow question how mani of the peopl report to you could you send home to never come without see a differ in your team’s perform the answer i between and and comment like it would be a great relief and a moral and perform booster if i could do that ar common the right peopl so the statem peopl ar our most valuabl resourc can not be right so i suggest it should be chang to the right peopl i our greatest resourc the wrong peopl ar not an asset it i a liabil thi exampl i about front line peopl and if the same rough statist i true also for manag it ha wors consequ the higher up in the organ you have the wrong peopl the more damag thei can do the best do more and more what happen in mani organ with the wrong peopl in the frontlin i that the best perform will do more and more and the lowest perform will do less and less a a front line leader it i more conveni for me to assign the peopl who i know will do the job well and without ani complain then to assign the less will and or less skill peopl to do a job thi will result in that the best perform will not onli do more work but thei will also becom more and more skill and the opposit will happen with the lower perform thi i also a typic phenomenon in so call self govern team some individu will not take the same work load a the rest of the team and the top perform ar driven by pride in what thei deliv the right peopl in the wrong position four year ago a mainten organ i recent work with had taken awai all mainten supervis and form so call self govern team the replac for the supervisor and planner role becam the respons of a rotat mainten contact person for each team the respons wa rotat a monthli basi research ha found that of peopl ar follow and onli ar good leader if thi i true it mean that the contact person role i the respons of the wrong person of the time thi also prove to be the fact the self govern team had becom veri reactiv and ineffect so now thi organ face thi fact and reinstitut the position of front line leader i believ it i true that in organ with mani wrong peopl of the work i done by of the peopl so if you have mani wrong peopl how do you chang thi in most case you can not do anyth in the veri short term such a ly peopl of or move them somewher els instead you look at ratio of attrition and hire peopl other criteria then you might have done in the past for exampl set a higher valu attitud and aptitud then skill or the fact that thei just happen to live close by or their father work in your plant if thi i not an accept timefram for chang and the situat i realli bad
