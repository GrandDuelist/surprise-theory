the church who ar suppos to be the bodi of christ that remind u that we ar faulti peopl or less than desir peopl and ar some how less valuabl than thei ar iv learn by experienc the cold shoulder of the church i believ jesu did just the opposit it wa the meek the poor and the oppress that he champion for what you do to the least of these you do unto me matt it ha been my experi that the peopl of the church and for peopl read thi i mean the univers church not thi particular church somehow have gotten the idea that if thei show peopl thei ar valuabl or love them it i the same a admit thei ar just like themselv and thei cant accept that thei can’t accept the fact that a poor person i the same a themselv or a sinner i just like them or even peopl that secular societi find reprehens i just a equal a thei ar in god’s ey love valu a person i not the same a accept the action but it becom an act of transform for the unvalu peopl of societi sadli the church ha becom a place of judgment and not place of transform billi graham wa onc ask why he attend a support ralli for bill clinton in the wake of hi sex scandal while in offic mr graham just said it i the holi sprit’s job to convict god’s job to judg and my job to love it the church job to truli love and transform live and not judg gari i believ your mom onc said you don’t realli know someon until you winter with them i would encourag the church to winter with peopl so thei can see we ar all alik and then love and valu on anoth can grow yeah it go to take an invest a time invest that i but how valuabl would peopl feel if we all
