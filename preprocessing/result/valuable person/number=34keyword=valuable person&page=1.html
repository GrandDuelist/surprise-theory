top expert in the world of user experi design uie s virtual seminar allow you to get your hand that inform to absorb a much a you can your schedul of cours you can keep up with all the shenanigan by sign up for uie s free newslett uietip intro music provid by bumpertun transcript jess mcmullin i am so pleas to be abl to introduc our next speaker it s actual hi fault that i work in user experi in my father in law brought home a handout from a confer he d been to and there were some thing in it that said white space i bad for peopl us websit and i spent the next two year try to prove that wrong and didn t actual laugh but our next speaker jare spool i the founder and princip of user interfac engin it s a research consult and event firm headquart out of boston or cambridg jare spool north andov actual jess north andov so boston for folk like me jare exactli laughter jess and jare s extraordinarili prolif ha a great sens of humor and tremend insight and i think on of the thing that i ve seen i that thing that peopl know in thi field that have becom canon or common sens or accept wisdom veri often find their wai to jare and the work of the team at uie there ar probabl thing that you know or that you have learn that you mai not know thei came from the work that these folk do but we all ow a great debt and i m alwai excit to find out what the next cool thing that he s been look at so with that you can hear from jare instead of from me so big round of applaus thank you jare applaus jare thank you jess hello so i have a histori of speak here at the summit i gave a keynot the second year spoken almost everi year sinc and i usual do i give about present a year or present a year but most of them ar repeat thei re thing i do over and over again so that i can eventu learn the materi but the summit i alwai differ becaus the summit i alwai a place where i bring out someth veri new and sometim it s not even someth i know anyth about thi year wa an unusu year becaus the convers start dure the plan cycl of last year when livia came and said i want you do someth realli differ thi year livia labat who start the process of pick the chair and set the program and defin what thi confer ha becom which by the wai it s awesom isn t it yeah cheer and applaus jare the team deserv to be commend the convers start with thi word she said i want you to talk about the market and i didn t know what she meant and it turn out in sort of bounc around it wa the market for ux work what doe that mean thi i someth that we ve been sort of think about becaus the work that we do at user interfac engin ha primarili for the last few year focus around what doe it mean to creat great design and in order to creat great design you have to have design and ux profession who ar go to be abl to execut those design and come up with the idea and everyth that s involv in that and so the question of thi idea of market wa an interest on becaus what doe that mean and so i start to do some research and market from an econom standpoint ha to do with thi idea of valu and so i got sort of hook thi idea of the most valuabl ux person who i that person how would we meet that person and so let s sort of down thi journei that i went through which i basic what we re go to talk about here i sort of the thought i had in my head a to how we went about think about thi market and let s think in term of a thought experi and the thought experi i thi imagin everi ux person in on room it s probabl a room just a littl bigger than thi and we were to have these peopl line up by valu and the idea of valu i veri simpl the better you ar the more you re to the left if you re not a good a the person to your left you stai to their right and so we would line everybodi up there would be some person who end up at the end on person who i in essenc right now the most valuabl person in ux that s just the wai it ha to work and by the wai there ha to be someon at the far right don t all line up but there i someon who i current the least valuabl person in ux but i m not interest in that person so much yet i will be in a moment i m more interest in the most valuabl person becaus that person i somehow do someth that everybodi els isn t thei re somehow provid valu in a wai that it might just be a littl bit more than the next person or it could be a ton more and so the idea i that there s on person now i start talk about thi to peopl and thei got realli upset at me thi idea that there s on person who i the most valuabl and i start think well other profess have thi so the first on of cours i thought about wa nascar laughter jare turn out that there i a most valuabl nascar driver it s dale earnhardt jr he earn over million make him by far the most valuabl now i ve attribut here valu to monei becaus in our world that i often a relationship that exist so dale earnhardt jr won like race in the last two year it s the most valuabl gui there s a second most valuabl gui jeff gordon million and a third jimmi johnson million toni stewart million i didn t even know these peopl exist until i start googl them but yet these ar the most valuabl nascar driver and no on can thi i can show you differ articl in forb and in nascar weekli and all sort of place that have the exact same list thi list i well understood everybodi s got dale at the top and everybodi els behind them and it s not just nascar that ha found thi amaz uniform now nascar i thi thing that ha uniform right thi i an entir sport that s base turn to the left laughter jare so you would think that thei would be you know rigor in their uniform but it s not just them the world of tenni i similar right roger feder i consid to be the most valuabl tenni player maria sharapova second most valuabl tenni player number three come in at rafael nadal serena william i number four so again we can rank the top tenni player we can rank the top nascar folk well mayb thi i just sport well turn out it s not just sport we can do the same thing for neurosurgeon it i consid that the best neurosurgeon in the world i philip gutin at ketter sloan you ne a neurosurgeon thi i the gui to go to i found differ citat that said he wa the best there were anoth that argu that it might be arthur dai but it s on of these two gui that s it thei ar consid the best neurosurgeon thi i interest to me that nascar and neurosurgeri share thi abil to tell who the best in their profess ar who i the most valuabl ux person now right befor i start to speak dan willi came up to inform me it wa him laughter and applaus jare he s take u out for drink later laughter jare so thi i the thought experi right who i thi person and what did thei do to get there that s the interest thing now here s the thing that s realli interest i m not the onli on who want to meet thi person thi lucki man or woman i actual highli desir right now all you have to do i go to silicon vallei and you will find no less than or differ compani right now who would hire thi person for whatev price that person want there ar compani out there who ar quit will there s a compani that just launch last week a compani call color million of ventur monei thei made it veri clear thei want to hire the world s best ux person who i that and that s the realli interest thing i we don t know now we can tell the differ between good and bad design let s take for exampl thi thi i the new york time websit thi i a design that wa orchestr by a team led by khoi vinh and the websit realli sort of chang the wai new wa present onlin when thei came out it had a veri strong us of grid a veri strong us of font thei had realli thought about the user experi in a varieti of differ wai thei made some choic right for instanc the link ar not underlin which sort of went against a lot of common wisdom a lot of thing that even i ve written about but it work now compar thi design to anoth new sourc thi on s call havenwork havenwork ha a complet differ approach to design laughter jare an interest us of white space a jess mention and a complet differ strong sens of grid i actual like thi grid a i scroll down here notic i ll keep go here we ve got six column here but it ll quickli drop to five and then to four and then down to three eventu it get down to two and on and then surprisingli enough it ll go off and do it own thing at some point the interest thing about the havenwork design and the new york time design i that thi design here if i were to survei profession peopl in our field which on i the better design we d be uniformli in agreem so to some extent we have thi abil to separ good from bad but i ve realli becom interest in the idea of separ the best from the good how do we separ out great from good what i the differ there ar instanc where we actual ne to know who the best peopl ar there ar problem that we have in thi world that realli could us the attent of the best folk and like i said in silicon vallei the free market i veri will at thi point to pai top dollar for the best folk so you ve got commerci interest that ar interest in find these peopl and you ve got project that ar veri import life and death world peac poverti literaci ani big social problem that we re deal with could realli us some excel ux design so know who these peopl ar know that we could put them a team and actual produc great result would be realli us to u it turn out that the more i thought about thi the more i realiz that there wa sort of a bigger thing happen here and part of it i that thi i an act of matur you couldn t alwai tell who the best tenni player wa you couldn t alwai tell who the best neurosurgeon wa it wasn t until those profess becam matur that thei actual could distinguish thi idea that there i a person who s best and so start to look at how do we find thi out how do we make thi decision how do we separ thi out now there ar differ wai that we do thi right for exampl in the world of movi hollywood us thing like the academi award to figur out what the best pictur i who the best actor i in a given year and who vote that but other actor and other movi maker thei decid amongst themselv so we could amongst ourselv who the best peopl ar if we knew how to identifi them you could us a merit base system right you could actual look at the product that peopl creat and go from there and i wa actual interest in thi idea so i put a question up quora i actual end up put it up twice becaus i didn t like the answer the first time and i thought well mayb i just phrase the question wrong so i came up with a complet differ wai of phrase it and i got pretti much the same answer the second time but the question that i put up the first time wa what ar the qualiti that defin the best ux person becaus there were all these question quora who s the best ux person in silicon vallei who s the best ux person in brazil who s the best ux person in franc right so i m think ok well how would you figur out that person s the best ux person so i want to know the qualiti on of the thing i love about quora i that you actual don t have to understand the question to provid answer laughter jare so it produc thi slew of answer i thought ok mayb i got the question wrong so i rephras it and i said how would you give advic to a hire manag who need to hire the best person i said imagin a project like world peac or literaci that ha the monei behind it and ha to hire the best ux person how would you give them advic to do that and again i got these answer thi on gui s answer wa well what you got to look for i good articul and clariti of thought that wa well articul and pretti clear but i don t know what it mean how mani peopl here have clariti of thought right now ok that s actual better than i imagin let s ask after the recept laughter jare hi second qualiti wa self abdic and appeal to a higher author laughter jare that s what he wrote what he explain when he explain thi wa that you shouldn t be design for yourself but in fact you should be design for user so you have to abdic your own opinion for your user opinion which i guess ar higher author do user research i what hi explan said but it s a strang wai to explain it oh and by the wai i got a whole bunch of research that sai actual you can design for yourself and be realli success so i m not sure that s true either then he said thi person ha to have empathi and accommod now i m glad accommod wa singular and not plural laughter jare though if you know someon who ha some good accommod in norwai i m go there a littl later thi year ne a place to stai and then final the fourth thing wa knowledg you have to have knowledg knowledg that s it just out of curios how mani peopl here feel thei have knowledg laugh ok good and just to make sure how mani peopl hate rais their hand in littl survei ok that s our margin of so the literatur actual ha a lot about these thing and you don t have to go veri far to find it there i a distinct of what make a person good or bad at someth and there ar basic four qualiti that go into thi the first i talent the second i skill the differ between these be talent i what you re born with and skill ar acquir and practic and can be master even if you weren t born with talent that support those skill and these ar veri import thing and separ out talent and skill i pretti easi to do onc you get an ey for it right for instanc we could look at maria sharapova the number two tenni player and if we want to look at her serv that s veri differ than when she s serv at parti on i talent on i skill but there ar lot of skill that have to do with ux and we ve been spend a lot of our research time try to acquir and understand what those skill ar and we ve actual put togeth a list of skill for thing we call experi design and so we can with understand how thing ar organ the site what we would refer to a the inform architectur but there i also make sure that the word that ar the actual ar meaning and compel there i be abl to manag the design process and understand how you re go to iter through the design and out idea there i be abl to go out talk to your user and get the inform you ne to pump into the design process there s figur out the flow and the wai that the interact will happen the screen there s be abl to displai the knowledg and data that you have in a wai that i compel and meaning and understand and clear that s good inform design of cours there s visual design which a lot of peopl think it s about aesthet but it s realli about clear commun and understand how you priorit the best inform out there there i edit and curat the fact that someon ha to be abl to sai no thi i not go to go in our design becaus it s go to make it more complic the act of sai no the act of know when thing come out so all of these thing ar kei core experi design skill that we ve identifi we ve been sort of plai with thi list now for a coupl of year and it realli ha stood the of time it s a veri concret list of cours in order to do a project there s actual a lot more skill you have to do you for instanc have to know how to go into the field and actual interview peopl and collect data you have to understand the design space that you re work in and what ar the problem that your design solv and how doe it solv it for those peopl there s alwai a busi that s involv that you have to be abl to deal with and understand how that busi i go to make monei and support it ongo activ there i of cours all the data that come into the organ that ha to be interpret and understood in the form of analyt there i be abl to talk about the valu that we bring whenev we put someth in the design and put it in front of the custom and the user be abl to understand and how to talk about that valu of cours there s the underli technologi that we re drive and how all of that work i kei there s be abl to explain that when we put all thi effort in we re go to get thi invest out and so understand how to talk about return invest i absolut kei a dana chisnel mention earlier there i thi whole social aspect we re no longer just a person and a machin everyth we do ha now got these social compon so we have to understand how to work in thi social space there i of cours be abl to talk to our develop team and explain to them what it i in the design that we want to be abl to execut and of cours we have to understand the wai that thei deal with those thing so we have all these sort of skill that ar realli import that ar not specif to ux but ar requir for u to get a design out the door and servic and then thi isn t even all of them turn out that a we start dig further we found anoth set of skill that turn out to be realli import we call these skill the liquid skill that you have to have thei have to do with be abl to take what you re try to do and put it in a form that s compel through good storytel be abl to talk in term of good and bad and have a wai of commun with your fellow team member about where you re try to go and how you re try to get there which i what critiqu i all about of cours sketch i all the rage now and it s a complet import skill of be abl to take an idea that s in your head and render it a so that peopl can see why you re try to do it and what you re try to build and you re not try to alwai commun thing in front of a white board with interpret danc the abil to present both to our team to our client to our peer i an absolut essenti skill and then final be abl to take a session and run it and actual sai ok we re go to with an object and we re go to achiev that object and make it happen and these ar the soft skill that realli drive what we do and all of these skill combin ar necessari and we start look at thi and we re realiz ok team have to have all these skill them yet while we were do the research project team size were actual get smaller we re actual us less peopl to do all these differ thing so thi i the pool of skill and thi isn t even a percent complet set it s just a work model that we us to talk about everyth that s requir from ux in order to get thing built and get thing creat what wa realli interest to me about the quora discuss i nowher in term of what do you look for wa there anyth like well you want to see if thei built anyth us you want to see if thei actual did someth that work that might have made monei did thei actual ship someth there were all thi discuss of soft skill and none of thi sort of hard skill stuff and so the other two piec to the puzzl in addition to talent and skill ar knowledg which i just we have to know a boatload of thing in order to just get thing done and these ar thing that we both sit down and studi and come to confer like thi and pick up and take workshop and class but there ar also thing that we just sort of learn intrins a we do our work and along with that come experi which just happen with time and i see thi becaus i get these dai to work with a lot of realli young design and ux peopl and thei re lack experi thei ve got skill and thei ve even got knowledg and thei ve got some real talent but thei don t have ani experi and thei make some realli amateurish mistak becaus that experi i realli import there i someth about do your time when i start work i wa not given choic i work in an arrang where i could not win i had a boss who told me exactli how thing were go to be done and if i tri to be creativ i got scold and yell at and wa told that s not the wai we re go to do it we re go to do it over until it s the wai he want it done and it wa a miser experi except i learn so much and i gain a ton of experi do it hi wai the thing that alwai remind me of experi i the old sai which i good judgment come from experi and experi come from bad judgment right we have to make those mistak we have to have the opportun to do that and we have to be abl to be in thi position to get there so we have all these skill that we re try to deal with a lot of u have some talent that make it easier for u to work in thi field but some of u don t some of u just push through and compens through the skill we have the knowledg and the experi there so now let s get to thi idea of valu what make on of u more valu than anoth so we can have thi idea of an inform architect we can have thi idea of an interact design i on more valuabl than anoth accord to the market right now inform architect ar not quit a valuabl a interact design why there s a lot of theori on could sai that it s becaus the interact design world ha just got better market i think it s not so much that i think it s becaus interact design ar better understood by the peopl who ar hire becaus thei can sort of see the screen thei can see the flow inform architectur unless you re work in larg inform space i a littl bit harder to sell to some folk so i think a lot more project can see a role and if thei have to on versu the other thei tend to go for the interact design right now there s a real shortag of interact design in the world in i wa ask to run a panel for the interact design associ where i made thi littl sort of off the cuff predict base someth that meg whitman had said meg whitman wa at the time the ceo of ebai she wa in the process of run it into the ground befor she ran her campaign into the ground but she had talk about how user experi wa go to be ebai s top prioriti at that point and so i sort of put out the hypothet question well what if the fortun world half of the compani follow along those line and said we ne to spend on percent of our budget some project that ha amaz ux so let s go do that it turn out that to fulfil on percent of your budget for half of the fortun compani would come to a ne for ux peopl and so the panel wa about where ar these peopl go to come from and i said if thi i the trend if thi i where we re go we re go to see a real shortag real soon and guess what we re start to see a real shortag right now that it s veri hard in some market to find a ux person who isn t veri well emploi and veri happi where thei ar if you re try to hire how mani peopl who work in compani that have had req for ux relat position now for month that thei can t fill yeah it s a stori i m see over and over again by the wai there s a whole bunch of peopl look for job thei ll be look for you dure the break so that s kei but we launch thi project a few month ago where we start to pai attent to job ad we start to look at the differ requir that were be ask for and job ad for ux peopl ar hyster funni for on thing thei want must be highli abdic and overli accommod plu six year of html experi laughter jare and year of e commerc experi and must be abl to program in java php javascript and some languag to be name later thi i actual it right if you talk to the peopl who ar look for folk right now the holi grail the thing thei will pai anyth for i the ux design who can code thei want that code ux design and of cours everi time on of the email list i m a job like thi get post there i email i can t believ someon actual want a design who can code becaus design if thei code thei re not veri good design if thei re not veri good coder thei re miser at both there s all thi sort of debat about thi but thi i the deal right what happen if you ar a good ux design who actual could write decent code you could get a job at on of these compani for a realli high price thi idea that someon could do that i actual not too farfetch and it s just a matter of time befor that s the norm and all of the ux folk ar go to be good coder if you re not a good coder you re not go to be a ux person and thi i sort of the evolut that we re go through i talk earlier about thi idea of skill and these skill current align to role that we ve all adopt that in fact there ar peopl who go by the titl that match percent to those skill but on of the realli interest thing about all these job ad that i ve been read through i that thei ar no longer ask for peopl with these role thei re not look for thi thei re just look for a ux design and then thei list all the skill thei want the realiti i the idea of discreet disciplin inform architectur interact design user research i go awai the hire manag do not want discreet peopl thei don t want to have to hire a team of six to do thi job thei would be veri happi with on person who did it all we can sit and try and fight thi all we want and sai no no no you can t possibl be a good inform architect if you re also a good user research becaus you can t possibl know both thing i don t believ that s true and i don t see ani evid to support it and frankli the market i not that interest in have these discreet disciplin anymor and i think over time i think we re go to see that go awai it s be replac and it s realli interest becaus i ve been try to figur out what s been go here what we re get now ar what i don t have a good name for it so i ve call it the specialti collect and the specialti collect ar thing like mobil design and servic design and content strategi content strategi right karen mcgrane thi morn convinc me and everybodi els in the room that we ar all now content strategist i didn t know that befor i got up thi morn but i m happi to have that titl hopefulli it pai well karen doe it pai well karen awai from mic jare ok well there we go everi time we do someth mobil design our registr number doubl and servic design i thi fanci new titl and i keep try to ask peopl what servic design and it s basic ux when you have a busi that s a servic ok laughter jare there i knowledg and experi that s us in these context when you group these thing togeth and you talk about thi stuff it realli i compel the work that folk like karen and kristina halverson and margo bloomstein and a bunch of realli smart peopl in the content strategi world ar do i realli impress becaus it give thi focu to the content and it merg all these differ aspect of the busi the creation of the content the manag of the content the organ of the content the govern who the hell decid when thi stuff i suppos to leav your site so that it s no longer there long after it us all of thi stuff i necessari so these collect of skill these collect of knowledg and experi and talent into thi special thing that we re now for todai call content strategi and mayb it will last for five year and mayb it will last for ten year that s great a long a we all can agre that these thing ar just an abil to do thi that s fine and you don t have to go veri far to see other exampl of thi in the world of medicin there s a branch of medicin known a physiatri physiatri i solv a real problem with modern medicin compar to other medic field it s veri young it s less than year old and it s deal with a real problem which i peopl whether it s sport relat or car accid or war injuri ar have traumat long term chronic pain issu these ar neurolog issu but thei have to be dealt with through pain manag and rehabilit neurologi rehabilit and pain manag tradition have been complet differ field that didn t realli work togeth or talk to each other so physiatrist form a school to teach these thing in on place and combin them thi i the fastest grow part of medicin todai i physiatri it s realli remark becaus these gui can talk to the neurosurgeon about the nerv damag that s there at the same time that thei talk to the rehab peopl about how treat that nerv damag work at the same time that thei can emploi import pain manag relat activ such a us non tradition medicin such a acupunctur or chiropracti look at result in deal with chronic pain until someon start focus that specialti with thi combin of three exist thing peopl were suffer and now a lot of peopl ar see a lot of progress in their condition becaus of the advent of physiatri and so that s how i think of thing like servic design and content strategi and there s ton of thi stuff there s multi cross channel stuff that samantha wa talk about earlier todai it s not hard to come up with these sort of collect of thing where we take these dispar disciplin and we combin them and we learn everyth we can about the whole packag and we to work togeth that and so i think that thi evolut i a natur on and it s part of thi matur process that we re talk about anoth wai that i see thi matur happen amongst our client ha to do with what we call skill distribut strategi the problem i i that in an organ if you try and have an inform architect and an interact design and a visual design and a user research you have a load balanc problem becaus the work that come into your team doe not come in equal for each of those job the visual design mai have wai too much work to do and the inform architect mai be sit around not do veri much peopl ar look and sai how do we distribut the skill across the team better we ve come across in our work with team that ar veri good at get product out some realli interest strategi on i what we call within team mentorship so you by do an assess you sai ok who s realli good at what and you figur out who like i in fact amongst your team the best inform architectur folk and who ar the best interact design folk you do a solid detail assess of each of these peopl and then interestingli enough a new project work come in when an interact design project come in you do not give it to the person who i best at interact design you give it to someon who s in the middl of the road the team thei mai be good at someth els but you give them the interact design thing and then you assign your best interact design to be their mentor thei re not actual allow to work the project thei ar there to teach that person to do that project when you do thi what you see i a rais of all the boat in the bai all of a sudden all of the skill of each person start to go up a the best peopl mentor the good peopl and you can to grow differ skill and so now all of a sudden you have more peopl your team who can handl ani given part of the packag depend the load and the distribut thi work realli well the other strategi that we re see that actual work in larg organ i what we call pollin or what some of our client call the foreign exchang program what you do i you grab peopl from complet unrel project possibl unrel job like you grab peopl out of support grab peopl from you know medic product to come work the websit and just on person two peopl at a time just sort of swap place just like you would do in foreign exchang with a high school kid and just like foreign exchang with the high school kid there s a lot of beer involv in thi particularli the german kid and so you bring them togeth and thei work a full project for it full durat six week eight week ten week twelv week whatev the durat of the project i thei ar there a thi person from thi other team and then in that process thei get mentor in do variou job the team with their skill and then you send them awai to their origin job with the intent that thei re now go to mentor other folk and within larg organ thi cross pollin program take a littl while to kick off but onc it get go it actual i realli power becaus not onli doe it publish the skill throughout the organ but it publish relationship throughout the organ becaus these peopl get to know folk in the differ depart thei now have someon to call over the websit team when thei have a question that might be relat and that turn out to be realli realli power the last piec of thi sort of evolut thing i want to take a littl digress into a pet project of mine which i understand the differ between engin and craft and to understand thi we have to sort of burn down a hous becaus there s a group of peopl there s an entir profess out there known a fire protect engin you ve probabl never heard of them but thei have an annual confer where of them combin and it s a huge event where there i all sort of workshop and train just like thi but there s a huge trade show where there ar fire truck in the trade show floor it s thi amaz amaz event to be a fire protect engin thi i differ than be a fireman the fire protect engin understand the code and the scienc behind fire thei understand what materi ar flammabl what aren t how to make someth flame retard what the distanc from a heat sourc ha to be in order for someth to be safe so how far do you ne to make sure flammabl materi ar awai from a sourc of heat all sort of thing thei understand how the sprinkler system work it turn out that there ar four differ wai that you can have a smoke detector and thei understand all of that the scienc behind that how mani you ne for everi squar foot how mani sprinkler you ne here s a fact that you probabl didn t know in a larg build like thi hotel there ar fan at the top of the emerg stairwel in the tower so there s what floor in thi hotel right thei re big fan but what you probabl didn t know i thei point in in the event of an emerg these fan blow air into the stairwel by blow air into the stairwel which of cours i where peopl ar evacu if someon open a door a floor that happen to have the fire and smoke it the air pressur from the stairwel will actual blow the fire into the floor not suck it into the stairwel beauti engin beauti think the folk at the nation fire protect associ who sort of put all thi thei have creat all of these standard and guidelin and thi i engin at it finest thi i understand the rule if you understand all the standard and the guidelin you can be a great fire protect engin you can save live that s amaz these gui don t save live thi i cirqu du soleil thi i not engin sure there s actual a lot of engin that goe into the trapez work but what make cirqu du soleil complet differ from everi other circu that s out there i their craft thei have a sens of style thei have a sens of artistri the wai thei put togeth their costum their music their movem the wai thei orchestr the entir show i done with thi sens of craft that ha complet revolution the circu industri and much of the perform industri the cirqu du soleil show ar the largest gross show in vega where it us to be headlin that would bring in the big buck it s now circu no on would have imagin but thei pull it off and thei do it through these amaz show thei ar extrem valuabl becaus of their craft now there i craft and style to everyth you do and i m sure that there ar fire protect engin who have develop their own craft and style but that s not what make them realli valuabl so the question i when we re talk about user experi i thi engin or i it craft and in our work there s a huge tension there s thi constant pull for instanc we know that the new york time websit wa actual realli well done and we know it wa done by khoi vinh and we know that hi style of us grid and font and typographi i realli uniqu to him everyth he s done follow thi pattern and you can see if you re train in hi work you can see that influenc in the wai that the time ha chang under hi watch so we know that hi style hi craft i part of what make the new york time websit realli cool now keep in mind it s a team effort there s a lot of peopl at the new york time who make those websit there but hi particular influenc i veri promin in that site he s not even there anymor it s still promin so we know that there s a craft elem to what we do certainli that s true in visual design and it s possibl that s true in interact design but what i the craft of inform architectur i there a work that we can look at and we sai oh yeah that s donna spencer s work i can tell do we have that sens that again i anoth elem of matur at the same time we have to keep thi engin basi we have to be abl to understand what i that minimum stuff that everybodi ha to know in order to make sure that we produc great stuff what i that base line knowledg and educ that we can build a curriculum around and we can actual identifi with scienc it becom that engin platform and that s a big challeng for u and i think that s go to be a huge piec of what s go to happen over the next few year a coupl of thing befor we go and drink a lot which i what i m plan to do there ar poster involv i am veri happi i have found if thi i your first ia summit you should know that poster improv with liquor thei re usual pretti good to with but thei just get better so there ar two challeng that i see that come out of all thi work the first on i if we want to help the hire manag figur out how to get the right person for the job mayb thei ne the best ux person mayb thei don t ne the best ux person but thei ne a realli good ux person how do we help them find that person there ar a few thing here on i i m go to mention the c word certif certif i inevit in our field it i onli a matter of time befor it happen certif i not necessarili a bad thing the primari custom of the certif i the hire manag the hire manag us certif a a short cut for what thei re get if we requir that everi hire manag understand ux at the depth or better than the peopl thei ar hire we will fail so we ne to give them a wai to tell whether what thei re get i good or not everi neurosurgeon who practic in the unit state i certifi to do so now that doesn t separ the good from the great but it at least get you to the good and we ne to have an establish of certif certif can come in a varieti of wai you can just declar yourself a certifi bodi and build up a set of cours and test and give it and then move to india and have a great time with that laughter jare you must be think of someon specif becaus i m not you can be an establish accredit school that ha done some work and put togeth a nice certif program that everybodi understand what the curriculum i and it come out of it i got to do a lot of work with lawyer and on of the thing i learn i how law school work peopl hire peopl from the law school thei went to becaus thei know the professor at the law school becaus thei know what law i be taught there and how it s taught so that thei know that the associ that thei re go to hire out of the law school will come with a certain set of skill in a certain wai i see that todai with the wai peopl hire from school like cmu cmu student tend to hire cmu student cmu alumni tend to hire cmu student why becaus thei know what s be taught whether it s the best or not it doesn t matter thei know what s there it s a short cut so understand certif i kei the other thing that i think i realli kei here i thi idea of understand the role of specialist and generalist and i ve been write about thi i put some articl johnni holland about it thi idea that you can be someon who ha a lot of skill and it s not thi t shape man which i thi silli notion of a person who ha on deep skill and lot of broad skill if you want to think of it that wai think of it a a broken cone person where you ve got a whole bunch of skill at differ length and you re constantli repair the cone to get them a littl better now you re go to get that imag out of your head the kei thing i that a generalist i someon who can do a good job across a varieti of skill a specialist i someon who actual ha depth in on or more skill such that thei can actual execut that and their experi and knowledg work to that skill but thei ar not a compartmentalist there s a gui at the lai clinic a doctor doctor margol who special in orthoped surgeri of hand and wrist that s all he doe i hand and wrist he i the best hand and wrist gui in the world peopl line up for six month to get an appoint with him he ha more patient than he can deal with he s up to hi elbow in hand and wrist laughter jare but in order to get hi accredit a a hand and wrist gui he went to medic school he studi gener medicin he did a rotat in obgyn just like everi other student in hi school he could deliv a babi if he had to deliv a babi if he wa the onli doctor the island he s the on you want to deliv the babi that s what it s about so even if we want to special in someth like content strategi we have to be abl to still keep up to date the non content strategi aspect of thi so that we can continu to work in that space anoth kei thing i thi idea of portfolio if we ar not just engin but craft craft ha to be abl to show style and show skill that i our elem and thi i where the portfolio come from but what s interest i in our work what we ve realiz i a lot of what we do i not the end product but the decision process by which we get there so the portfolio ha to talk about the decision we have made and how we made them if you want to put togeth a portfolio here i a great thing that i ve learn that realli awesom hire manag will ask you about if you don t have it which i an chart put in chart for the team that you work the project with so that when you re go over the portfolio you can sai i work with thi person thi part of the project and we work togeth here and i work with these other peopl thi part of the project thi person here wa a pain in the ass and i wa abl to appeas them by do thi work and thi stuff be abl to talk to that chart i absolut kei and final which i think i realli import be that we re here togeth under the hospic of inform architectur and the iei i i think the hire manag can be the number on custom of our profession organ the thing that we can do the best i to actual help hire manag i think it should be the number on initi of everi singl on of our differ upa ixda fbu cia tla tla i the acronym for three letter acronym the trick i come i can tell you thi i realli a kei elem and i think that a member of these organ we ne to ask ourselv what ar we do for hire manag not just to sell u a a profess but to realli help them understand how to who amongst u i the best for their position final how do we becom that best person how doe each of u becom that individu and here i think there s a coupl of kei thing on of the thing that s emerg from the work we ve been do in our research i the sheer import of practic and critiqu how mani peopl here have user experi peopl work for them in some fashion or anoth ok keep your hand up if you have dedic time each week at least two hour for those peopl to just practic keep it up if you actual have practic time hardli anybodi you look at the best tenni player and what do thei do when thei re not plai a game thei re the tenni court hit ball basebal player ar out practic thi i not an accid malcom gladwel talk about hour i know that s my iei bingo card somewher if you have to have hour of expert where ar you go to get that practic so everi week we should have sever hour dedic to not the project work we re but practic someth whether it s sketch whether it s ideat whether it s plai game out of dave grei and sunni brown s game storm book there s ani number of practic relat activ that have to be part of our basic work and critiqu i the other piec we do not do a good job of critiqu tomorrow adam conner adam who ar you present with i m sorri aaron adam and aaron ar do a fabul session if it s like the on i saw adam do last time critiqu the role of critiqu and the separ of where we re try to get from what we actual do and have a wai to actual commun amongst our peer in a product commun wai to talk about good and bad again thi i on of the thing that separ out the great organ that we tend to see from the on that realli struggl i that the great on have dedic practic and dedic critiqu elem the other thing i i think we ne to re think what we ar do with mentorship and apprenticeship that our exist notion of you just find somebodi and you talk to them everi coupl of month i not mentorship mentorship i actual look over their work a regular basi and deliv the bad new that right now thei suck apprenticeship i be realli humbl and put your best work forward and then find out that guess what you still suck and the connect of that and have that in our workplac i absolut kei i think that s absolut essenti we do not have word that tell u what the differ i between good and bad design we do not have a languag of what make up good design and what make up bad design i think these languag have to happen and i think these languag when thei come about will be realli us thi i the work that we ve been do with design principl becaus when you establish design principl that ar to a specif project i m not talk about the global design principl of we have to make our design human and univers but i m talk about specif principl that sai in thi releas we ar go to focu discover over complet that s a principl and we re go to focu that now we have to have convers for the next four month about what the hell we meant by discover and what the hell we meant by complet and that discuss creat a vocabulari it creat an understand and we ne to realli push that in to that and final we have to build up our curriculum we have to understand what doe it take to do a good job and then what separ the good from the great we have to figur out who i do great work and to realli to some extent idol and emul those folk much in the wai that peopl idol franci ford coppola or peopl idol feder or ani other top of their craft type individu we have to build that up and then dissect what thei do to deserv that idolatri becaus i think in that process we will come up with a curriculum that will teach u what it actual mean to be great and that will help u figur out who the best ux person in the world i and that s what i came to talk to you about applaus post juli origin url tag user experi post navig keynot nate silver beyond
