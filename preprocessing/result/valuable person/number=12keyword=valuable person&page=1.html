the valu of an individu base in the impact of hi action in societi in fact we do thi all the time peopl with great impact at ani level politician artist entrepreneur religi ar admir protect and follow in our societi thi mean that rest of u conscious or unconsci price them over rest of common peopl and thi i becaus of the amount of peopl their action can reach so the valu of a person speak not onli in the materi sens but also spiritu can be measur if in ani given circumst societi should decid who to protect or who to keep aliv between someon who s action impact mani peopl or someon who s action impact a small amount the first on would be the onli viabl choic due to collectiv the good thing i that we all have the potenti to becom valuabl and therefor a viabl choic to societi shariq hashm apr ye it s not someth that can be answer in on go i rais thi question think perhap someon mai have someth veri good to add to my chain of thought someth i m miss i think thi i the onli answer that actual understand what i wa try to ask i ll try ask the question again peopl in recent time have come to the conclusion that racism sexism or ani form of judg peopl base a characterist not chosen by the peopl be judg i complet wrong everyon s happi a few year later we to get confus societi i scare to acknowledg that it i judg peopl for veri valid reason but it i judg peopl not by race gender class but by for exampl test their scholast aptitud via the sat and judg their scholast aptitud by thi and that s why societi i confus it i consid plain wrong to judg peopl and even though societi doe it all the time we don t like to discuss how we do it there i noth wrong with judg peopl if i see a teen swear at hi parent and anoth teen treat their parent with respect i will judg the former a be less valuabl to societi than the latter i am not go to spend a month stalk both of the teenag to make sure my judgem wa justifi and i am not go to complet ignor what happen becaus i m scare of judg the two teen if i spend a month stalk both of the teenag i ll spend a whole lot of my time worri about thing that don t concern me if i complet ignor what just happen i lose part of my human i lose empathi empathi i more than feel piti empathi i also to dislik a person who i do someth you consid hurt to societi but not an ironclad hate that never goe awai and not a hidden hate that nobodi ever know

someon said a racist joke immedi she told the person to leav her home she then said in the interview when peopl show you who thei ar believ them in my opinion it isn t that the person i not valuabl the author chose to not be around a racist person to anoth racist person the remark would have elicit a laugh but to a person who view everyon alik the remark show a lack of love and so she made the person leav i think that we know what we stand for and then to be around peopl with the same moral goal lifestyl a u not becaus thei ar more or less valuabl but becaus thei make u more comfort and of cours member of societi who want to caus harm to other have to be dealt with and i don t lose empathi i feel sadden when someon choos to act in a wai that ha seriou repercuss my desir i for peopl to
