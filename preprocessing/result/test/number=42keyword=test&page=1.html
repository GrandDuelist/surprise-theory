instal to us xfiniti spe xfiniti spe should work in ani browser that support flash at least flash i requir to us the current version of xfiniti spe those with a version earlier than will not be abl to us the applic we recommend us the most current version of flash avail javascript i also us heavili throughout the site even to displai the flash so make sure you don t have it disabl how do i get the most accur spe result xfiniti spe give the most accur result when you ar connect to the internet via a direct cabl from your comput to your cabl modem connect which reli wireless signal strength mai have vari result that do not repres the full potenti of your servic make sure you ar connect to the internet directli via your cabl modem make sure you ar not download or upload anyth close ani other program that ar us the internet turn off ani other comput tablet game consol that share your home network what i the best wai to us xfiniti spe to best util xfiniti spe find the server that provid the fastest and most consist result then against that server frequent to identifi trend and make sure you ar get what you expect from your connect in most case the server with the shortest physic distanc from your locat will be have the best result how doe xfiniti spe work the xfiniti spe oper over multipl tcp session the tcp session make us of port port the three stage of the ar ping download and upload ping latenc thi i perform by measur the time it take to get a respons for a tcp request sent to the server it i done time with the averag valu determin the final result download a small binari file i download from the server to the client to estim the connect spe base thi result on of sever file size i select to us for the real download the download i perform with cach prevent via a random string append to each download spe i measur up to time per second order sampl ar look at through a slide averag window to elimin anomali and determin the result upload a small amount of random data i gener in the client and sent to the server to estim the spe of the connect base thi result an appropri size set of randomli gener data i select for upload the upload i then perform in chunk which ar push to the server an overal averag i us to determin the result the spe i a true measur of spe between the server and client http fallback in the case that tcp port i not avail the spe will fall to us http port you mai notic a slight delai when initi a why doe xfiniti spe sai i ne at least flash version when i alreadi have it xfiniti spe us javascript to detect your flash version if you ar certain that javascript i enabl then there could be an in your flash instal thi problem i usual solv by uninstal and then reinstal flash why doe the download work but the upload doe not or vice versa thi i usual the result of someth instal your comput that i intercept traffic between your browser and the server exampl of thi would be secur softwar from zonealarm mcafe or symantec try momentarili disabl the softwar to see if it i the sourc of the problem make sure you don t leav it disabl ani softwar firewal should work with xfiniti spe if configur properli a an exampl if us zonealarm you must make sure that none of the box ar check in the custom cooki control menu what do my spe result mean kilobit kb kilobyt kb megabit mb megabyt mb kb and mb ar measur of data file size and storag kbp and mbp ar short for kilobit per second and megabit per second and ar measur of data transfer rate also known a connect spe to estim how long it take to download a larg file base upon your connect spe you can us the follow mathemat equat convert file size to mb connect spe in mbp of second to complet download for exampl if your connect spe i mbp then you could theoret download a mb file in approxim on second mb x mb mbp second what i ping and how i it measur ping xfiniti spe i a bit differ than a tradition command line ping which us icmp we ar measur the time it take to get a respons for a tcp request sent to the server the number mai be higher than an icmp ping but the rel valu to other test i still veri us the server with the lowest ping will usual be the server that provid the most accur spe result why am i see two result for downstream spe and two result for upstream spe the latest version of the xfiniti spe allow xfiniti custom to against two distinct network protocol ipv and ipv xfiniti i the industri leader in the deploy of the new next gener internet protocol ipv where avail two distinct set of spe result will be provid a ipv i current be deploi across the xfiniti footprint not all xfiniti custom will see two set of spe result for more inform the xfiniti ipv deploy pleas visit our ipv inform at what i the differ between spe test perform over ipv v ipv the latest version of the xfiniti spe allow xfiniti custom to against two distinct network protocol ipv and ipv ipv and ipv spe test i perform the same wai calcul your spe base file transfer to and from a specif server the onli differ between these test i which network protocol i us ipv or ipv for more inform the xfiniti ipv deploy pleas visit our ipv inform at why i thi spe show faster spe result than other test the result from xfiniti spe repres an estim of the maximum connect spe for download and upload a file size between kb and mb there ar a number of other variabl which could impact your spe result from a third parti site for exampl when us a rd parti spe site your traffic mai travel over network that ar not control by comcast those peer network mai have an effect the overal spe in addition the rd parti s engin could be us a singl thread tcp connect dure test thi counteract the abil to reach higher spe a there i more wait time from the packet be sent and receiv from the rd parti spe server our spe server i run simultan thread which i model to reflect normal brows across current avail websit also the rd parti site mai not be us file that ar larg enough to permit an accur read for spe tier with higher spe actual spe mai vari and ar not guarante how doe xfiniti spe know where i am xfiniti spe us geoip data from maxmind to determin your locat it then calcul your current distanc from the server you select why doesn t the closest server provid the best spe result the internet doe not oper in direct path to reach a spe server your traffic mai not be rout in a direct line to the server s geograph locat thi increas distanc mai result in increas latenc which mai impact your result obtain the best result by try sever differ server why doe network distanc affect spe you have like notic that download from a local server locat i faster than a distant on thi i becaus the tcp window i not optim for the increas latenc that come from an increas in distanc the tcp window size determin how mani packet can be sent at on time the larger the window size the higher the spe increas latenc decreas the tcp window size doe comcast guarante my servic will achiev my subscrib spe no neither comcast nor other isp will guarante that specif spe will alwai be avail while comcast provision it network to provid up to the maximum spe avail with your servic a number of factor affect spe and the actual spe you receiv mai vari mani of the factor affect spe ar beyond comcast s control for exampl spe can be affect by the type of comput you have the process capac of your comput the applic run your comput and the natur of your home network connect in addition the websit you visit the capabl of third parti network and congest the internet mai affect internet spe why would the capabl of a websit or a third parti network affect my spe variou websit cap the spe at which consum ar permit to download or stream content those websit mai also becom congest which could further slow your connect to that websit the internet ha been describ a a network of network comcast s network i interconnect with the network of a number of third parti and comcast can onli control the servic it own network if a third parti s network i congest or ha other limit spe you mai not be abl to achiev your provision download spe to that specif websit why ar my wireless connect spe slower than my wire connect spe there ar mani variabl that could impact your spe when connect to the internet through a wireless network for exampl microwav static electr fluoresc light window wall type and thick distanc band and signal set multipl devic the same channel and sever other factor can impact the spe you receiv when wirelessli connect to the internet these wifi variabl can add substanti delai which mai
