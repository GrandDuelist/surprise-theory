java tester what version of java ar you run websit bymichael horowitz home javavers javanew installingjava othertest javascript about see my defens comput blog at computerworld com what version of java ar you us a comput with multipl browser be sure to the java version in everi browser i sai thi becaus multipl copi of java can sometim be instal with differ browser us differ copi also java can be enabl in on browser and disabl in anoth note the portion of java that run program i refer to a either the java run time environ jre or the java virtual machin jvm method ask javathi i my favorit straight from the hors s mouth so to speak the java run time environ i awar of it version and the compani that author it so i wrote a veri simpl applet the sourc code i the about that get thi inform from the jre and displai it in a pink rectangl the version and vendor from the jre if java i work you will see a pink rectangl abov with on line of text that sai someth like java version from oracl corpor or java version from oracl corpor or java version from sun microsystem inc or java version from appl inc version number translat i in english java updat the initi i ignor a i the third digit ask oracl why run thi applet java secur ha chang quit a lot over the year and run thi applet ha gotten much more complic in part thi i becaus the applet i unsign in the bizarro world of oracl unsign applet ar treat a more danger than sign applet thi i backward for two reason first unsign applet run in a restrict java sandbox wherea sign applet ar given unrestrict access to the system ye the sandbox ha been buggi and broken but some secur i better than none second it show a faith in the certif author system that i unwarr a of oct and java updat and java updat the applet abov can be run with java set to the default high secur level there will be assort a you sure type prompt both from java and your browser but it will run howev thi site javatest ne to first be ad to the except site list us the java control panel when ad site to the list you have to prefix them with http colon slash slash java will object to http but it will accept it there i no http version of thi site also if you add javatest to the list you must then go to javatest a will fail becaus it i unsign thi applet will not run with java set to the veri high secur level new secur in java updat januari updat chang the default secur rule for unsign java applet such a the on thi by default java no longer run ani unsign applet in the java control panel the default secur level with updat i high which oracl describ a java applic identifi by a certif from a trust author will be allow to run what thi doe not sai i that unsign applet will not run at least not by default if you get an thi that sai applic block by secur set thi i probabl why on wai to run an unsign applet i to lower the secur level to medium the other wai i to add trust websit to a new except list that oracl java maintain thi list i not to be confus with the list of trust applet that or chrome maintain ye there ar now three list of applet that ar naughti and nice your browser li java updat introduc a new checkbox that disabl the us of java
