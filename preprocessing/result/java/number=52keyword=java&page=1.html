chang an entiti of on datatyp into anoth thi i import for the type convers in develop ani applic java arrai in java arrai arrai i the most import thing in ani program languag by definit arrai i the static memori alloc it alloc the memoryfor the same data type in sequenc it contain multipl valu of same type copi an arrai to anoth in thi tutori you will learn how to copi data from on arrai to anoth here provid you an exampl with code and it explan to given below charat method in java in thi section you will get the detail explan about the charat method of string class we ar go for us charat method length method in java in thi section you will learn how to us length method of the string class we ar go to us length method touppercas method in java here you will see the procedur of convert letter of the string in uppercas letter string arrai in java in thi section you will learn how to us string arrai in java here you will see how to declar a string arrai and the syntax for us in the program averag of arrai in thi section we will learn how to get an averag of arrai for thi first of all we have to defin a class name arrayaverag that ha doubl type arrai to contain some valu matrix exampl in java in java tutori you will learn about arrai and matrix an arrai i the collect of same data type valu if we creat a variabl of integ type then the arrai of int can onli store the int valu sum of two matrix in thi section we ar go to calcul the sum of two matrix and contain it row and column see below for better understand to thi multipl of two matrix thi i a simpl java program that teach you for multipli two matrix to each other here provid you java sourc code with understand the java develop applic program squar elem of two dimension arrai thi i a simpl java program for implem the two dimension arrai program and it squar thi session provid you the best explan with mathemat oper even odd exampl now you have to learn about the syntax of if els construct how the if els construct us to flow the program control a for a need java break statem in java break the break statem i us in mani program languagessuch a c c java etc some time we ne to exit from a loop beforeth completion of the loop then we us break java continu statem in java continu the continu statem i us in mani program languagessuch a c c java etc sometim we do not ne to execut some statementsund the loop then we us the continu statem that stop the normal flow ofth control and control return to the loop without execut the statementswritten after the continu statem java the switch construct in java switch i the control statem in java which also turn the normal flowcontrol of the program a per condition it work same a if elseconstruct thi i the differ between switchand if els construct that switch i usedfor reduc the if statem switch statem exampl in java thi i veri simpl java program for implem the switch statem here you will learn how to us the switch statem in your java program for develop java applic while loop loop i the control statem of ani languag in which whenev you want to perform the repetiti work then youus the loop controlstat do while loop in java in some condition in java you ne to run some statem and processesonc at least for that you have to us the do while loop in after that the condition then we us the do while loopstat for loop in java the for loop i the type of loop construct it also work a while loopconstruct but it provid the initi condition and the incrementi same written in the for construct java class object and method in java class whatev we can see in thi world all the thing ar a object and all the object ar categor in a special group that group i term a a class java constructor in java constructor i the method which name i same to the class but there aremani differ between the method function and the constructor constructor overload in java constructor ar us to assign initi valu toinstanc variabl of the class a default constructor with no argum will becal automat by the java virtual machin jvm us of thi keyword in java the keyword thi i us when you needto refer to instanc of the class from it method java thread in java thread i the featur of mostli languag includ java thread allow theprogram to perform multipl task simultan process spe can be increasedbi us thread becaus the thread can stop or suspend a specif runningprocess and or resum the suspend process occurr of elem in an arrai thi section illustr you how to calcul occurrencesof elem in an arrai occurr mean the how mani time an elem occursin the arrai changeth user input to integ isn t it averi tediou job to enter the valu each time befor the compil in themethod itself now if we want to enter an integ valu after the compil ofa program and forc the jvm to ask for an input then we should useinteg parseint string str make token of a string we have to break a string into token a well asw will know how mani token ha been gener that s what we ar try to doin thi program arrai list exampl in java in thi exampl we ar go to show the us of java util arraylist we will be creati an object of arraylist class and perform variou oper like ad remov the object convert a filenam to a url a file object i us to a give a filenam creat the file object doesn t mean that a file exist it mai be that the doe not exist suppos if the file exist first of all we ne to convert the file object in url for thi we us a method tourl it return a url object and throw malformedexcept after thi we will convert thi url to a file object by us getfil method we will read thi file by us bufferedread object creat a temporari file in thi program we ar go to make a temporari file which will be delet automat by the garbag collector when the program end exampl of date class we can us date class to us current date in thi program we ar creat a date object and by us it we ar go to displai the current date and time it implem serializ cloneabl compar interfac it known subclass ar date time timestamp determin if two filenam path refer to the same file thi program i go to determin that the file name refer to the same file or not what you ne to do i to creat two file object and pass the file name in the constructor of both the file class now match both the file instanc it will return fals if the file path ar not equal to send the true valu we first have to normal both the path onli after that it will return true determin if a filenam path i a file or a directori you can solv thi problem veri easili what you ne to do just creat a file object and pass some file name or a directori in it determin if a file or directori exist thi i a veri simpl problem you just have to determin whether a file or directori exist or not ifit exist itreturn trueotherw in the els condition it retun vice versa forc updat to a file to the disk in thi program we ar go to updat a file forcefulli firstli we have to make an object of outputstream and pass a file name in which you want to updat in the constructor of a fileoutputstream class after that pass some data to the stream the method we ar us in thi class ha alreadi been discuss in other topic link list exampl in java in thi exampl we ar go to show the us of java util linkedlist class you will be creat an object of link list class and perform variou oper like ad and remov object list the file system root in thi exampl we will list out all the drive in the disk thi requir an arrai of file class where all the drive will get store by us onli on method read a file into a byte arrai in thi program we will read a file in the form of a byte arrai we can do it veri easili firstli we will creat an object of file class and pass the name of the file which we want to read in the constructor of file class we will us datainputstream to read primit data type implem a serializ singleton in singeton class onli on instanc will be creat we ar go to serial the class thi can be done veri easili what we ne to do i to implem a java io serializ interfac we will us a method of serializ interfac that i readresolv exampl of java stack program stack i like a bucket we you can enter object and retriev it here in the exampl describ the method to prepar an exampl of java stack program the stack class repres a last in first out lifo stack of object it extend class vector and implem cloneabl collect list serializ interfac we mostli us push and pop oper vector exampl in java in thi exampl we ar go to show the us of java util vector class we will be creat an object of vector class and perform variou oper like ad remov etc vector class extend abstractlist and implem list randomaccess cloneabl serializ the size of a vector increas and decreas accord to the program vector i synchron calcul the checksum of a file adler adler it i a check techniqu us to the accuraci of data while transmit it to the other end error ar check while the data i transfer thi scheme i a reliabl a crc but it i much faster to comput calcul the checksum of the file crc crc crc mean cyclic redund it i a check techniqu us to the accuraci of data while transmit it to the other end error ar check while the data i transfer crc perform some type of calcul befor transmit the data and send the result to the other end the other end repeat the same oper befor accept the data if both the devic get the result same it mean the transmiss i free compress the file into gzip format thi exampl will help to understand the concept of gzip gzip compress the actual size of data file it i a file compress util program which can be found veri easili found internet it result file will have a gz extens it main advantag i that it provid excel level of compress it can be us where you want to save the file in less avail area it will compress the file to the great extent it i a part of java util zip packag construct a file name path thi java program tutori will teach you how you can construct a file name path by us the construct filenam path it i possibl to set dynam path which i help for map local file name with the actual path of the file us of arrai in java thi java program exampl will teach you the the concept of arrai so that you can write a program arrai by yourself an arrai work a contain object which can hold a valu of same type the length of an arrai i creat when the arrai i go to be creat arrai can be creat in follow wai on wai to creat a arrai i by us new oper e g a new int it will creat an arrai of type int which can store integ valu the next wai to defin arrai i just same a we have defin an arrai in the program below arrai should be us where you have to store multipl valu of the same type for exampl if we have to store month of the year then the better idea i to make an arrai of it exampl of static method thi java program exampl will teach you the wai to defin a static method in java we have two type of method instanc method and static method static method can t us ani instanc variabl the thi keyword can t be us in a static method you can find it difficult to understand when to us a static method and when not to us if you have a better understand of the instanc method and static method then you can know where to us instanc method and static method uncompress the file in the gzip format thi exampl will help you to understand the concept of gzip sometim it happen that when you download a file or ani pdf file you get it in compress mode thi mean that the file i compress but can t read it in compress form so it ne to be uncompress there ar variou uncompress ion util program which can be found veri easili found internet if you ar uncompress a pdf with the extens gz then it result file will have a pdf extens it main advantag i that it will uncompress the pdf file so that you can be abl to read it thi util i a part of java util zip packag which provid class and method to compress and decompress the file exampl of a instanc variabl when a number of object ar creat from the same class the same copi of instanc variabl i provid to all rememb each time you call the instanc the same old valu i provid to you not the updat on in thi program we ar show that how a instanc variabl i call in each instanc but the copi remain same irrespect the counter we have us in the constructor of a class we can t call the non static variabl in a main method if we try to call the non static method in the main method then the compil will prompt you that non static variabl cannot be referenc from a static context we can call the non static variabl by the instanc of the class exampl of a class variabl static variabl thi java program exampl will teach you how you can defin the static class variabl in a class when a number of object ar creat from the same class each instanc ha it own copi of class variabl but thi i not the case when it i declar a static static swap of two number thi java program tutori will teach you the method for write program to calcul swap of two number swap i us where you want to interchang the valu thi program will help you to increas your program abil swap two ani number from keyboard thi i a simpl java orient languag program if you ar newbi in java program then our tutori and exampl ar help for understand java program in the simplest wai calcul the checksum of a byte arrai by us adler adler it i a check techniqu us to the accuraci of data while transmit it to the other end error ar check while the data i transfer thi scheme i a reliabl a crc but it i much faster to comput the byte i an bit sign primit data type quantiti the minimum valu the byte i and maximum valu i it i sign becaus it can take both neg and posit valu the byte class wrap a valu of primit type byte in an object a object of type byte contain a singl field whose type i byte calcul the checksum of a byte arrai by us crc crc it i a check techniqu us to the accuraci of data while transmit it to the other end error ar check while the data i transfer compar the file date thi java exampl will help you to compar the date of file in java we have the option to compar two or more file thi i us when we have to compar the file mostli it happen that after creat a file or a directori we forget when it wa made or last modifi and sometim it becom essenti to know the exact date and time of creation by thi exampl you will be abl to understand it get a absolut path to find a file or directori it i veri necessari to know the path of the file or directori so that you can access it if you know the path then it i veri easi to work it suppos a situat where a problem come in front you where you don t know the path of the file then what will you do then thi problem can be solv by us a method getabsolutepath the method getabsolutepath should be us where we don t know the exact path of the file make token of a
