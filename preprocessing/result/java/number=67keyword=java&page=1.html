can commun to the serial port via the rxtx java librari that librari i veri similar to the java commun api extens intern the id rememb which port and baud rate you us last time unfortun that intern implement can not be consid public api you can reliabl us so you will have to keep your own set to rememb which com port your arduino card i us thi interfac sampl presum that you alreadi know how to compil and run java code there ar plenti of other resourc the internet to teach you to program in java most seriou java programm us a java id to creat java program like the free eclips id but thi exampl provid inform for the less frequent java programm arduino board set upbefor you begin interfac with your arduino board you must have the arduino id instal and configur onc it i instal try thi simpl sketch you can us the serial monitor of the id to verifi that the board i set up correctli void setup serial begin void loop serial println hello world delai rxtx librari set upif you instal the arduino id you alreadi have the rxtx librari instal for the next step and you mai be abl to skip thi section and with the sampl java code if you instal a separ copi of the rxtx you can do on of the follow platform indeped not requir for linux with the new method when start java us the djava librari path command line argum to state where the jni librari ar locat for exampl you could us java djava

of the rxtx java librari at the packag extract file go to linux and the folder which correspond to your system configur copi all the file from the previou folder to jre lib machin type i for instanc

the sampl code mention abov thi batch file can be us your system but you mai ne to modifi the path to match the instal locat of your java and arduino id your system setlocalset path=%path%;c program file x arduino c program file x java jdk bin javac cp c program file x arduino lib rxtxcomm jar serialtest java c program file x java jdk bin java cp c program file x arduino lib rxtxcomm jar serialtest basic you will ne to add the rxtxcomm jar to your class path and you will ne to add the associ jni interfac dll rxtxserial dll to your path for other platform you will ne to add the same jni share librari to your run time path when you run the run bat file you should see the same result a the arduino id serial monitor you can us ctrl+break to stop the program macosxpresum that you ar us the sampl code abov you mai ne to do the follow step us the termin chang to the directori contain the file to be compil compil the file us replac filenam with your java class name javac classpath rxtxcomm jar serialtest java if you place the rxtx librari into librari java extens the file can be compil by simpli us javac serialtest java now it i time to run the compil sourc code thi requir inclusion of the jni share librari into the librari path by us the command below java djava librari path cp rxtxcomm jar serialtestif you place the rxtx jar and librari in the librari java extens folder rather than the directori that contain the le to be compil the le can be run without the librari path a shown below java serialtest the code should now run successfulli and print the serial output to the screen a with the arduino serial monitor mac o x architectur match problemsif you get an messag tell you the librari i not match architectur it might be due to macosx snow leopard try to execut the program in bit mode if you run into thi problem try the vm argum d to forc the java program to be execut in bit mode mac o x lockingif you encount ani issu with the port be unabl to be lock these instruct mai help if you set up the arduino environ thi should not be an issu thi also doe not seem to be an issu with rxtx version the rxtx librari place it lock le in the folder var lock which sometim doe not exist termin and creat the lock directori a root by us the follow command sudo mkdir var lockand enter your root password when prompt the appropri permiss ne to be appli to the var lock directori to allow the program to be run without be root it i necessari to make sure you re in the group uucp and make sure the directori ha group write permiss to uucp replac usernam with your proﬁle user name sudo dscl append group uucp groupmembership usernam sudo chgrp uucp var lock sudo chmod var lock a port in us except gnu io portinuseexcept with version might also be solv by chang permiss us the sh script from jlog must have follow the step in the linux part befor to compil just lunch javac serialtest java then type java serialtest and it should work transmit data to the arduino from the comput in my experi it seem that the serial connect must be connect somewher abov second i have second in my program befor a transmiss can be made it seem that for at least the atmega and diecimila do so ensur your transmiss actual i transmit for do that thread sleep delai i us and delai i specifi in millisecond so i would us thread sleep after the serial port i establish it seem thi might be due to the program reset when a serial connect i made and the program ha a necessari setup time the outputstream come with differ write method to send data from the comput to the arduino in the abov exampl you could us output write string to send data a in output write hello arduino there s also on that ll send an integ valu and anoth that will transmit an arrai of byte i found the arduino s program to accur receiv the data instead of receiv non intellig data point i had to maintain a gener delai between the serial read command i end up us m for safe measur but the actual necessari number i like much lower and on could us a filter to extract meaning data assum none of your meaning data consist of the number the simpl serial read function will process a byte at a time although there ar more interest read function avail proper port handlingif you want to properli close the port you should call the close method the serial port object upon program exit thi will prevent the port from be lock after your program exit you mai notic thi issu linux and not window the serial port s close method should be call from a method that i synchron with the serialev method which will prevent ani except from appear dure program shutdown share newslett arduino copyright notic contact u
