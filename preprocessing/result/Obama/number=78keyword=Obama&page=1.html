among nation and there ar those who hear talk of a world without nuclear weapon and doubt whether it s worth set a goal that seem imposs to achiev but make no mistak we know where that road lead when nation and peopl allow themselv to be defin by their differ the gulf between them widen when we fail to pursu peac then it stai forev beyond our grasp we know the path when we fear over hope to

have come here to cairo to seek a new begin between the unit state and muslim around the world on base upon mutual interest and mutual respect and on base upon the truth that america and islam ar not exclus and ne not be in competit instead thei overlap and share common principl principl of justic and progress toler and the digniti of all human be i am convinc that in order to move forward we must

a stori with a simpl truth violenc i a dead end it i a sign of neither courag nor power to shoot rocket at sleep children or to blow up old women a bu that i not how moral author i claim that i how it i surrend i know there ha been controversi about the promotion of democraci in recent year and much of thi controversi i connect to the war in iraq so let me be clear no system of govern can or should be impos upon on nation by ani other that doe not lessen my commit howev to govern that reflect the will of the peopl each nation give life to thi principl in it own wai ground in the tradition of it own peopl america doe not presum to know what i best for everyon just a we would not presum to pick the outcom of a peac elect but i do have an unyield belief that all peopl yearn for certain thing the abil to speak your mind and have a sai in how you ar govern confid in the rule of law and the equal administr of justic govern that i transpar and doesn t steal from the peopl the freedom to live a you those ar not just american idea thei ar human right and that i why we will support them everywher now there i no straight line to realis thi promis but thi much i clear govern that protect these

them and we will welcom all elect peac govern provid thei govern with respect for all their peopl thi last point i import becaus there ar some who advoc for democraci onli when thei ar out of power onc in power thei ar ruthless in suppress the right of other no matter where it take hold govern of the peopl and by the peopl set a singl standard for all who hold power you must maintain your power

abov your parti without these ingredi elect alon do not make true democraci islam ha a proud tradition of toler peopl in everi countri should be free to and live their faith base upon the persuasion

will be advanc by allow all human men and women to reach their full potenti i do not believ that women must make the same choic a men in order to be equal and i respect those women who to live their live in tradition role but it should be their choic the face of global i contradictori the internet and televis can bring knowledg and inform but also offens sexual and mindless violenc into the home trade can bring new wealth and opportun but also huge disrupt and chang to commun in all nation includ america thi chang can bring fear fear that becaus of modern we will lose of control over our econom choic our polit and most importantli our ident those thing we most cherish about our commun our famili our tradition and our faith but i also know that human progress cannot be deni there ne not be contradict between develop and tradition in ancient time and in our time muslim commun have been at the forefront of innov and educ no develop strategi can be base onli upon what come out of the ground nor can it be sustain while young peopl ar out of work all of u must recogn that educ and innov will be the currenc of the st centuri we will encourag more american to studi in muslim

isn t worth the effort that we ar fate to disagre and civil ar doom to clash mani more ar simpli sceptic that real chang can occur there i so much fear so much mistrust that ha build up over the year

to remak thi world all of u share thi world for but a brief moment in time the question i whether we spend that time focus what push u apart or whether we commit ourselv to an effort a sustain effort to find common ground to focu the futur we seek for our children and to respect the digniti of all human be it s easier to war than to end them it i easier to blame other than to look inward it i easier to see what i differ about someon than to find the thing we share but we should the right path not just the easi path there i on rule that li at the heart of everi religion that we do unto

the militari of a nation in the midst of two war on of these war i wind down the other i a conflict that america did not seek on in which we ar join by other countri includ norwai in an effort to defend ourselv and all nation from further attack still we ar at war and i m respons for the deploy of thousand of young american to battl in a distant land some will kill and some will be kill and so i come here with an acut sens of the cost of arm conflict fill with difficult question about the relationship between war and peac and our effort to replac on with the other terror ha long been a

wreck civil societi torn asund refuge amass children scar i do not bring with me todai a definit solution to the problem of war what i do know i that meet these challeng will requir the same vision hard work and persist of those men and women who act so boldli decad ago and it will requir u to think in new wai about the notion of just war and the imper of a just peac we must begin by acknowledg the hard truth we will not erad violent conflict in our lifetim there will be time when nation act individu or in concert will find the us of forc not onli necessari but moral justifi i make thi statem mind of what martin luther king jr said in thi same ceremoni year ago violenc never bring perman peac it solv no social problem it mere creat new and more complic on a someon who stand here a a direct consequ of dr king s life work i am live testimoni to the moral forc of non violenc i know there s noth weak noth passiv noth naïve in the cre and live of gandhi and king but a a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation i cannot be guid by their exampl alon i face the world a it i and cannot stand idl in the face of threat to the american peopl for make no mistak evil doe exist in the world a non violent movem could not have halt hitler s armi negoti cannot convinc al qaeda s leader to lai down their arm to sai that forc mai sometim be necessari i not a call to cynic it i a recognit of histori the imperfect of man and the limit of reason the world must rememb that it wa not simpli intern institut not just treati and declar that brought stabil to a post world war ii world whatev mistak we have made the plain fact i thi the unit state of america ha help underwrit global secur for more than six decad with the blood of our citizen and the strength of our arm the servic and sacrific of our men and women in uniform ha promot peac and prosper from germani to korea and enabl democraci to take hold in place like the balkan we have born thi burden not becaus we seek to impos our will we have done so out of enlighten self interest becaus we seek a better futur for our children and grandchildren and we believ that their live will be better if other children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosper so ye the instrum of war do have a role to plai in preserv the peac and yet thi truth must coexist with anoth that no matter how justifi war promis human tragedi the soldier s courag and sacrific i full of glori express devotion to countri to caus to comrad in arm but war itself i never gloriou and we must never trumpet it a such i believ that all nation strong and weak alik must adher to standard that govern the us of forc i like ani head of state reserv the right to act unilater if necessari to defend my nation nevertheless i am convinc that adher to standard intern standard strengthen those who do and isol and weaken those who don t more and more we all confront difficult question about how to prevent the slaughter of civilian by their own govern or to stop a civil war whose violenc and suffer can engulf an entir region i believ that forc can be justifi humanitarian ground a it wa in the balkan or in other place that have been scar by war inact tear at our conscienc and can lead to more costli intervent later that s why all respons nation must embrac the role that militari with a clear mandat can plai to keep the peac i understand why war i not popular but i also know thi the belief that peac i desir i rare enough to achiev it peac requir respons peac entail sacrific that s why nato continu to be indispens that s why we must strengthen u n and region peacekeep and not leav the task to a few countri let me make on final point about the us of forc even a we make difficult decision about go to war we must also think clearli about how we fight it where forc i necessari we have a moral and strateg interest in bind ourselv to certain rule of conduct and even a we confront a viciou adversari that abid by no rule i believ the unit state of america must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war that i what make u differ from those whom we fight that i a sourc of our strength that i why i prohibit tortur that i why i order the prison at guantanamo bai close and that i why i have reaffirm america s commit to abid by the geneva convent we lose ourselv when we comprom the veri ideal that we fight to defend and we honor we honor those ideal by uphold them not when it s easi but when it i hard i believ that we must develop altern to violenc that ar tough enough to actual chang behavior for if we want a last peac then the word of the intern commun must mean someth those regim that break the rule must be held account sanction must exact a real price intransig must be met with increas pressur and such pressur exist onli when the world stand togeth a on peac i not mere the absenc of visibl conflict onli a just peac base the inher right and digniti of everi individu can truli be last it wa thi insight that drove drafter of the univers declar of human right after the second world war in the wake of devast thei recogn that if human right ar not protect peac i a hollow promis there ha long been a tension between those who describ themselv a realist or idealist a tension that suggest a stark choic between the narrow pursuit of interest or an endless campaign to impos our valu around the world i reject these choic i believ that peac i unstabl where citizen ar deni the right to speak freeli or worship a thei pleas their own leader or assembl without fear pent up grievanc fester and the suppress of tribal and religi ident can lead to violenc we also know that the opposit i true onli when europ becam free did it final find peac america ha never fought a war against a democraci and our

that we all hope for the chanc to live out our live with some measur of happi and fulfil for ourselv and our famili and yet somehow given the dizzi pace of global the cultur level of modern it perhap

for human freedom when our interest and valu ar at stake we have a respons to act in just on month the unit state ha work with our intern partner to mobil a broad coalition secur an intern mandat to

of a libya that belong not to a dictat but to it peopl born a we ar out of a revolut by those who long to be free we welcom the fact that histori i the move in the middl east and north africa and that young peopl ar lead the wai becaus wherev peopl long to be free thei will find a friend in the unit state for gener we have done the hard work of protect our own peopl a well a million around the globe we have done so becaus we know that our own futur i safer our own futur i brighter if more of mankind can live with the bright light of freedom and digniti i’d like to updat the american peopl the intern effort that we have led in libya what we’ve done what we plan to do and why thi matter to u i want to begin by pai tribut to our men and women in uniform who onc again have act with courag profession and patriot thei have move with incred spe and strength becaus of them and our dedic diplomat a coalition ha been forg and countless live have been save meanwhil a we speak our troop ar support our alli japan leav iraq to it peopl stop the taliban’s momentum in afghanistan and go after al qaeda all across the globe a command in chief i’m grate to our soldier sailor airmen marin coast guardsmen and to their famili and i know all american share in that sentim for gener the unit state of america ha plai a uniqu role a an anchor of global secur and a an advoc for human freedom mind of the risk and cost of militari action we ar natur reluct to us forc to solv the world’s mani challeng but when our interest and valu ar at stake we have a respons to act that’s what happen in libya over the cours of these last six week if we wait on more dai benghazi a citi nearli the size of charlott could suffer a massacr that would have reverber across the region and stain the conscienc of the world it wa not in our nation interest to let that happen i refus to let that happen and so nine dai ago after consult the bipartisan leadership of congress i author militari action to stop the kill and enforc u n secur council resolut in just on month the unit state ha work with our intern partner to mobil a broad coalition secur an intern mandat to protect civilian stop an advanc armi prevent a massacr and establish a no fly zone with our alli and partner to lend some perspect how rapidli thi militari and diplomat respons came togeth when peopl were be brutal in bosnia in the s it took the intern commun more than a year to interven with air power to protect civilian it took u dai i want to be clear the unit state of america ha done what we said we would do that’s not to sai that our work i complet while our militari mission i narrowli focus save live we continu to pursu the broader goal of a libya that belong not to a dictat but to it peopl much of the debat in washington ha put forward a fals choic when it come to libya the on hand some question why america should interven at all even in limit wai in thi distant land thei argu that there ar mani place in the world where innoc civilian face brutal violenc at the hand of their govern and america should not be expect to polic the world particularli when we have so mani press ne here at home it’s true that america cannot us our militari wherev repress occur and given the cost and risk of intervent we must alwai measur our interest against the ne for action but that cannot be an argum for never act behalf of what’s right in thi particular countri libya at thi particular moment we were face with the prospect of violenc a horrif scale we had a uniqu abil to stop that violenc an intern mandat for action a broad coalition prepar to join u the support of arab countri and a plea for help from the libyan peopl themselv we also had the abil to stop qaddafi’s forc in their track without put american troop the ground to brush asid america’s respons a a leader and more profoundli our respons to our fellow human be under such circumst would have been a betray of who we ar some nation mai be abl to turn a blind ey to atroc in other countri the unit state of america i differ and a presid i refus to wait for the imag of slaughter and mass grave befor take action america ha an import strateg interest in prevent qaddafi from overrun those who oppos him a massacr would have driven thousand of addition refuge across libya’s border put enorm strain the peac yet fragil transition in egypt and tunisia the democrat impuls that ar dawn across the region would be eclips by the darkest form of dictatorship a repress leader conclud that violenc i the best strategi to cling to power the writ of the unit nation secur council would have been shown to be littl more than empti word crippl that institution’s futur credibl to uphold global peac and secur so while i will never minim the cost involv in militari action i am convinc that a failur to act in libya would have carri a far greater price for america there i no question that libya and the world would be better off with qaddafi out of power i along with mani other world leader have embrac that goal and will activ pursu it through non militari mean but broaden our militari mission to includ regim chang would be a mistak the task that i assign our forc to protect the libyan peopl from immedi danger and to establish a no fly zone carri with it a u n mandat and intern support it’s also what the libyan opposit ask u to do if we tri to overthrow qaddafi by forc our coalition would splinter we would like have to put u s troop the ground to accomplish that mission or risk kill mani civilian from the air the danger face by our men and women in uniform would be far greater so would the cost and our share of the respons for what come next to be blunt we went down that road in iraq thank to the extraordinari sacrific of our troop and the determin of our diplomat we ar hope about iraq’s futur but regim chang there took eight year thousand of american and iraqi live and nearli a trillion dollar that i not someth we can afford to in libya a the bulk of our militari effort ratchet down what we can do and will do i support the aspir of the libyan peopl we have interven to stop a massacr and we will work with our alli and partner to maintain the safeti of civilian we will deni the regim arm cut off it suppli of cash assist the opposit and work with other nation to hasten the dai when qaddafi leav power it mai not happen overnight a a badli weaken qaddafi tri desper to hang to power but it should be clear to those around qaddafi and to everi libyan that histori i not qaddafi’s side with the time and space that we have provid for the libyan peopl thei will be abl to determin their own destini and that i how it should be a command in chief i have no greater respons than keep thi countri safe and no decision weigh me more than when to deploi our men and women in uniform i’ve made it clear that i will never hesit to us our militari swiftli decis and unilater when necessari to defend our peopl our homeland our alli and our core interest that s why we’re go after al qaeda wherev thei seek a foothold that i why we continu to fight in afghanistan even a we have end our combat mission in iraq and remov more than troop from that countri there will be time though when our safeti i not directli threaten but our interest and our valu ar sometim the cours of histori pose challeng that threaten our common human and our common secur respond to natur disast for exampl or prevent genocid and keep the peac ensur region secur and maintain the flow of commerc these mai not be america’s problem alon but thei ar import to u they’re problem worth solv and in these circumst we know that the unit state a the world’s most power nation will often be call upon to help in such case we should not be afraid to act but the burden of action should not be america’s alon a we have in libya our task i instead to mobil the intern commun for collect action becaus contrari to the claim of some american leadership i not simpli a matter of go it alon and bear all of the burden ourselv real leadership creat the condition and coalition for other to up a well to work with alli and partner so that thei bear their share of the burden and pai their share of the cost and to see that the principl of justic and human digniti ar upheld by all when on of our airmen parachut to the ground in a countri whose leader ha so often demon the unit state in a region that ha such a difficult histori with our countri thi american did not find enemi instead he wa met by peopl who embrac him on young libyan who came to hi aid said we ar your friend we ar so grate to those men who ar protect the ski thi voic i just on of mani in a region where a new gener i refus to be deni their right and opportun ani longer ye thi chang will make the world more complic for a time progress will be uneven and chang will come differ to differ countri there ar place like egypt where thi chang will inspir u and rais our hope and then there will be place like iran where chang i fierc suppress the dark forc of civil conflict and sectarian war will have to be avert and difficult polit and econom concern will have to be address the unit state will not be abl to dictat the pace and scope of thi chang onli the peopl of the region can do that but we can make a differ i believ that thi movem of chang cannot be turn and that we must stand alongsid

you bui store and analyz our data and us it for commerci purpos that’s how those target ad pop up your comput and your smartphon period but all of u understand that the standard for govern surveil must be higher given the uniqu power of the state it i not enough for leader to sai trust u we won’t abus the data we collect for histori ha too mani exampl when that trust ha been breach our system of govern i built the premis that our liberti cannot depend the good intent of those in power it depend the law to constrain those in power what’s at stake in thi debat goe far beyond a few month of

depend peopl and nation of goodwil continu affirm them of cours neither the unit state nor europ ar perfect in adher to our ideal nor do we claim to be the sole arbit of what i right or wrong in the world we ar human after all and we face difficult choic about how to exerc our power but part of what make u differ i that we welcom critic just a we welcom the respons that come with global leadership no amount of propaganda can make right someth that the world know i wrong there will alwai be voic who sai that what happen in the wider world i not our concern nor our respons but we must never forget that we ar heir to a struggl for freedom our democraci our individu opportun onli exist becaus those who came befor u had the wisdom and the courag to recogn that our ideal will onli endur if we see our self interest in the success of other peopl and other nation and it i you the young peopl of europ young peopl like laura who will help decid which wai the current of our histori will flow do not think for a moment that your own freedom your own prosper that your own moral imagin i bound by the limit of your commun your ethnic or even your countri you’re bigger than that you can help u to a better histori that’s what europ tell u that’s what the american experi i all about in the end the success of our ideal come down to u includ the exampl of our own live our own societi we know that there will alwai be intoler but instead of fear the immigr we can welcom him we can insist polici that benefit the mani not just the few that an ag of global and dizzi chang open the door of opportun to the margin and not just a privileg few instead of target our gai and lesbian brother and sister we can us our law to protect their right instead of defin ourselv in opposit to other we can affirm the aspir that we hold in common that’s what will make america strong that’s what will make europ strong that’s what make u who we ar and just a we meet our respons a individu we must be prepar to meet them a nation becaus we live in a world in which our ideal ar go to be challeng again and again by forc that would drag u into conflict or corrupt we can’t count other to rise to meet those test and that’s the question we all must answer what kind of europ what kind of america what kind of world will we leav behind and i believ that if we hold firm to our principl and ar will to our belief with courag and resolv then hope will ultim overcom fear and freedom will continu to triumph over tyranni becaus that i what forev stir in the human heart it’s not a sign of strength anybodi can make threat anyon can move an armi anyon can show off a missil that doesn’t make you strong it doe not lead to secur or opportun or respect those thing don t come through forc thei have to be earn and real strength i allow an and participatori democraci where peopl can their own leader and their own destini and real strength i allow a vibrant societi where peopl can think and prai and speak their mind a thei pleas even if it’s against their leader especi if it’s against their leader real strength i allow free and market that have built grow thrive middl class and lift million of peopl out of poverti young southeast asian leader initi town hall april the most import thing for and mayb the most import thing for all the young peopl here i to realiz that you realli can have an impact the world you can achiev your dream but in order to do so you have to focu not so much a titl or how much monei you’re go to make you have to focu more what kind of influenc and impact ar you go to have other people’s live what good can you do in the world we must recogn that democraci don’t stop just with elect thei also depend strong institut and a vibrant civil societi and polit space and toler of peopl who ar differ than you we have to creat an environ where the right of everi citizen regardless of race or gender or religion or sexual orient ar not onli protect but respect the most import thing that i learn a a young person try to bring about chang i you have to be persist and you have to get more peopl involv and you have to form relationship with differ group and differ organ and you have to listen to peopl about what they’re feel and what they’re concern about and build trust and then you have to try to find a small part of the problem and get success that first so that mayb from there you can someth els and make it bigger and make it bigger until over time you ar realli make a differ in your commun and in that problem but you can’t be impati treat peopl with respect whoever thei ar and expect your govern to treat everybodi with respect and if you do that then you’re go to be okai remark by presid obama at young southeast asian leader initi town hall univers of malaya kuala lumpur malaysia april now on of the thing that make thi region so interest i it divers that divers creat a uniqu intersect of human peopl from so mani ethnic group and background and religi and polit belief i give malaysia a on primari exampl the chanc to prove a america constantli tri to prove that nation ar stronger and more success when thei work to uphold the civil right and polit right and human right of all their citizen partnership like those remind u that the relationship between nation i not just defin by govern but i defin by peopl especi the young peopl who will determin the futur long after those of u who ar current in position of power leav the stage no nation i immun to danger and disrupt weather pattern so everi nation i go to have to do it part and the unit state i readi to do our last year i introduc america’s first ever climat action plan to us more clean energi and less dirti energi and cut the danger carbon pollution that contribut to climat chang so we want to cooper with countri in southeast asia to do the same to combat the destruct of our forest we can’t condemn futur gener to a planet that i beyond fix we can onli do that togeth america i the world’s oldest constitut democraci that mean we’re go to stand up for democraci it’s a part of who we ar and we do thi not onli becaus we think it’s right but becaus it’s been proven to be the most stabl and success form of govern in recent decad mani asian nation have shown that differ nation can realiz the promis of self govern in their own wai thei have their own path but we must recogn that democraci don’t stop just with elect thei also depend strong institut and a vibrant civil societi and polit space and toler of peopl who ar differ than you we have to creat an environ where the right of everi citizen regardless of race or gender or religion or sexual orient ar not onli protect but respect we know that progress can alwai be revers and that posit chang i achiev not through passion alon but through patient and persist effort but we’ve seen thing chang for the better in thi region and around the world becaus of the effort of ordinari peopl togeth work togeth and when i think to my journei my past i think the most import thing for and mayb the most import thing for all the young peopl here i to realiz that you realli can have an impact the world you can achiev your dream but in order to do so you have to focu not so much a titl or how much monei you’re go to make you have to focu more what kind of influenc and impact ar you go to have other people’s live what good can you do in the world now that mai involv start a busi but if you want to a busi you should be realli excit about the product or the servic that you’re make it shouldn’t just be how much monei i can make becaus the busi peopl who i meet who do amaz thing like bill gate who start microsoft they’re usual peopl who ar realli interest in what thei do and thei realli think that it can make a differ in people’s live if you want to go into govern you shouldn’t just want to be a particular govern offici you should want to go into govern becaus you think it can help educ some children or it can help provid job for peopl who ne work so i think the most import thing for me wa when i start think more about other peopl and how i could have an impact in my larger societi and commun and wasn’t just think about myself that’s when i think your dream can realli take off becaus if you’re onli think about you then your world i small if you‘re think about other then your world get bigger the world ha gotten smaller and no countri i go to succe if part of it popul i put the sidelin becaus they’re discrimin against no societi i go to succe if half your popul mean women aren’t get the same educ and employ opportun a men so i think the kei point for all of you especi a young peopl i you should embrac your cultur you should be proud of who you ar and your background and you should appreci the differ in languag and food and how you worship god i go to be differ and those ar thing that you should be proud of but it shouldn’t be a tool to look down somebodi els it shouldn’t be a reason to discrimin and you have to make sure that you ar speak out against that in your daili life and a you emerg a leader you should be the side of polit that bring peopl togeth rather than drive them apart that i the most import thing for thi gener and part of the wai to do that i to be abl to stand in other people’s shoe see through their ey almost everi religion ha within it the basic principl that i a a christian understand from the teach of jesu do unto other a you would have them do unto you treat peopl the wai you want to be treat and if you’re not do that and if societi i not respect that basic principl then we’re go backward instead of go forward and when you see astronaut from japan or from the unit state or from russia or other work togeth and they’re look down at thi planet from a distanc you realiz we’re all thi littl rock in the middl of space and the differ that seem so import to u from a distanc dissolv into noth and so we have to have that same perspect respect everybodi treat everybodi equal under the law that ha to be a principl that all of you uphold so first of all you’ve got to try to get peopl involv and a lot of peopl ar busi in their own live or thei don’t think it’s go to make a differ or they’re scare if they’re speak out against author and mani of the problem that we’re face like try to creat job or better opportun or deal with poverti or deal with the environ these ar problem that have been go for decad and so to think that somehow you’re go to chang it in a dai or a week and then if it doesn’t happen you just give up well then you definit won’t succe so the most import thing that i learn a a young person try to bring about chang i you have to be persist and you have to get more peopl involv and you have to form relationship with differ group and differ organ and you have to listen to peopl about what they’re feel and what they’re concern about and build trust and then you have to try to find a small part of the problem and get success that first so that mayb from there you can someth els and make it bigger and make it bigger until over time you ar realli make a differ in your commun and in that problem but you can’t be impati and the great thing about young peopl i they’re impati the biggest problem with young peopl i they’re impati it’s a strength becaus it’s what make you want to chang thing but sometim you can be disappoint if chang doesn’t happen right awai and then you just give up and you just have to stai with it and learn from your failur a well a your success but what you’ve also seen i a trend in the unit state but also around the world in which even when the economi grow it tend to benefit a lot of peopl at the veri top but the vast major of peopl thei don t benefit a much and you re start to see bigger and bigger gap in inequ and in wealth and in opportun and that s true not just in the unit state it s true in europ it s long been true in part of asia it s been true in latin america and i believ that economi work best when growth and develop i broad base when it s share when ordinari peopl if thei work hard and thei take respons thei can succe not everybodi i go to be rich but everybodi should be abl to live a good life not everybodi i go to be a billionair but everybodi should be abl to have a nice home and educ their children and feel some sens of secur invest in peopl i the singl most import thing in the knowledg economi tradition wealth wa defin by land and natur resourc todai the most import resourc i between our ear treat peopl with respect whoever thei ar and expect your govern to treat everybodi with respect and if you do that then you’re go to be okai despit how hard sometim the world seem to be and all you see televis i war and conflict and poverti and violenc the truth i that if you had to when to be born not know where or who you would be in all of human histori now would be the time becaus the world i less violent it i healthier it i wealthier it i more toler and it offer more opportun than ani time in human histori for more peopl than ani time in human histori now that doesn’t mean that there aren’t still terribl thing happen around the world or in thi region we still have thing like human traffick and we still have terribl abus of children and there ar conflict and so these ar thing that we’re go to have to tackl and deal with but you should know that with each success gener thing have improv just a littl bit and over time that littl bit add to a lot and it’s now up to you the next gener to make sure that year from now or year from now peopl look and sai wow thing ar a lot better now than thei were then and there will still be problem or year from now also but thei will be differ problem becaus you will have solv mani of the problem that exist todai th anniversari of polish freedom dai speech june democraci i more than just elect true democraci real prosper last secur these ar neither simpli given nor impos from the

steal from the pocket of their own peopl our societi must embrac a greater justic that recogn the inher digniti of everi human be and a we’ve been remind by russia’s aggress in ukrain our free nation cannot be complac in pursuit of the vision we share a europ that i whole and free and at peac we have to work for that we have to stand with those who seek freedom we stand togeth becaus we believ that peopl and nation have the right to determin their own destini and that includ the peopl of ukrain rob by a corrupt regim ukrainian demand a govern that serv them beaten and bloodi thei refus to yield threaten and harass thei line up to vote thei elect a new presid in a free elect becaus a leader’s legitimaci can onli come from the consent of the peopl we stand togeth becaus we believ that uphold peac and secur i the respons of everi nation the dai of empir and sphere of influenc ar over bigger nation must not be allow to bulli the small or impos their will at the barrel of a gun or with mask men take over build and the stroke of a pen can never legitim the theft of a neighbor’s land so we will not accept russia’s occup of crimea or it violat of ukraine’s sovereignti our free nation will stand unit so that further russian provoc will onli mean more isol and cost for russia becaus after invest so much blood and treasur to bring europ togeth how can we allow the dark tactic of the th centuri to defin thi new centuri thank you poland thank you for your courag thank you for remind the world that no matter how brutal the crackdown no matter how long the night the yearn for liberti and digniti doe not fade awai it will never go awai thank you poland for your iron will and for show that ye ordinari citizen can grab the rein of histori and that freedom will prevail becaus in the end tank and troop ar no match for the forc of our ideal there i no chang without risk and no progress without sacrific and no freedom without solidar remark to the peopl of estonia septemb we’re not afraid of free and fair elect becaus true legitimaci can onli come from on sourc and that i the peopl we have to uphold a free and freedom of speech becaus in the end li and misinform ar no match for the truth the more countri ar free and strong and free from intimid the more secur our own liberti ar do not lose the ideal and optim that i the root of all great chang don’t ever lose the faith that sai if we want it if we ar will to work for it if we stand togeth the futur can be differ tomorrow can be better and so long a free peopl summon the confid and the courag and the will to defend the valu that we cherish then freedom will alwai be stronger and our idea will alwai prevail no matter what remark by presid obama to the peopl of estonia i e student young profession civil leader and the peopl of estonia at the nordea concert hall in tallinn estonia septemb but the peopl of the baltic nation also knew that freedom ne a foundat of secur your experi caution that progress i neither easi nor quick we’re stronger becaus we’re democraci we’re not afraid of free and fair elect becaus true legitimaci can onli come from on sourc and that i the peopl we’re not afraid of an independ judiciari becaus no on i abov the law we’re not afraid of a free or vibrant debat or a strong civil societi becaus leader must be held account we’re not afraid to let our young peopl go onlin to learn and discov and organ becaus we know that countri ar more success when citizen ar free to think for themselv becaus of the work of gener becaus we’ve stood togeth in a great allianc becaus peopl across thi contin have forg a european union dedic to cooper and peac we have made histor progress toward the vision we share a europ that i whole and free and at peac and yet a we gather here todai we know that thi vision i threaten by russia’s aggress against ukrain it i a brazen assault the territori integr of ukrain a sovereign and independ european nation it challeng that most basic of principl of our intern system that border cannot be redrawn at the barrel of a gun that nation have the right to determin their own futur it undermin an intern order where the right of peopl and nation ar upheld and can’t simpli be taken awai by brute forc and even a we meet convent threat we ne to face other challeng and that includ propaganda campaign that try to whip up fear and divid peopl from on anoth we reject the idea that peopl cannot live and thrive togeth just becaus thei have differ background or speak a differ languag and the best antidot to such distort think ar the valu that defin u not just in the baltic but throughout europ we must acknowledg the inher digniti and human right of everi person becaus our democraci cannot truli succe until we root out bia and prejudic both from our institut and from our heart we have to uphold a free and freedom of speech becaus in the end li and misinform ar no match for the truth we have to embrac and inclus societi becaus our countri ar more success and more prosper when we welcom the talent of all our peopl includ minor that’s part of the work that we must do that s the exampl we must set and thi bring me to the final area where our nation have to come togeth in our steadfast support for those who reach for their freedom and ye that includ the peopl of ukrain and few understand thi better than the baltic peopl you know from bitter experi that we can never take our secur and liberti for grant we want ukrainian to be independ and strong and abl to make their own choic free from fear and intimid becaus the more countri ar free and strong and free from intimid the more secur our own liberti ar in the face of violenc that seem intract and suffer that i so senseless it i easi to grow cynic and i think tempt to give in to the notion that peac and secur mai be beyond our grasp but i sai to all of you here todai especi the young peopl do not give into that cynic do not lose the ideal and optim that i the root of all great chang don’t ever lose the faith that sai if we want it if we ar will to work for it if we stand togeth the futur can be differ tomorrow can be better ye there will be setback and there will be frustrat and there will be moment of doubt and moment of despair the current of histori ebb and flow but over time thei flow toward freedom more peopl in everi corner of the earth stand up and reach to claim those right that ar univers and that’s why in the end our ideal ar stronger and that’s why in the end our ideal will win digniti will win becaus everi human be i born equal with free will and inalien right and ani regim or system of govern that tri to deni these right will ultim fail and countri that uphold them will onli grow stronger justic will win becaus might doe not make right and the onli path to last peac i when peopl know that their digniti will be respect and that their right will be upheld and citizen like nation will never settl for a world where the big ar allow to bulli the small sooner or later thei fight democraci will win becaus a government’s legitimaci can onli come from citizen becaus in thi ag of inform and empower peopl want more control over their live not less and becaus more than ani other form of govern ever devis onli democraci root in the sanctiti of the individu can deliv real progress and freedom will win not becaus it’s inevit not becaus it i ordain but becaus these basic human yearn for digniti and justic and democraci do not go awai thei can be suppress at time thei can be silenc but thei burn in everi human heart in a place where no regim could ever reach a light that no armi can ever extinguish and so long a free peopl summon the confid and the courag and the will to defend the valu that we cherish then freedom will alwai be stronger and our idea will alwai prevail no matter what statem isil septemb thi i a core principl of my presid if you threaten america you will find no safe haven we ar strongest a a nation when the presid and congress work togeth statem by the presid the islam state of iraq and the levant isil at the state hall of the white hous in washington d c septemb i have made it clear that we

militari action there ar risk involv especi to the servicemen and women who carri out these mission but i want the american peopl to understand how thi effort will be differ from the war in iraq and afghanistan it will not involv american combat troop fight foreign soil thi counterterror campaign will be wage through a steadi relentless effort to take out isil wherev thei exist us our air power and our support for partner forc the ground thi strategi of take out terrorist who threaten u while support partner the front line i on that we have successfulli pursu in yemen and somalia for year and it i consist with the approach i outlin earlier thi year to us forc against anyon who threaten america’s core interest but to mobil partner wherev possibl to address broader challeng to intern order despit all the division and discord within our democraci i see the grit and determin and common good of the american peopl everi singl dai and that make me more confid than ever about our country’s futur america our endless bless bestow an endur burden but a american we welcom our respons to lead from europ to asia from the far reach of africa to war torn capit of the middl east we

minist the most import titl i citizen it i citizen ordinari men and women determin to forg their own futur who throughout histori have spark all the great chang and progress these citizen remind u why civil societi i so essenti when peopl ar free to speak their mind and hold their leader account govern ar more respons and more effect when entrepreneur ar free to creat and develop new idea then economi ar more innov and attract more trade and invest and ultim becom more prosper when commun includ minor ar free to live and prai and love a thei choos when nation uphold the right of all their

across border to make our commun healthier our environ cleaner and our world safer that s when real chang come address to the unit nation septemb no extern power can bring about a transform of heart and mind peac i not mere the absenc of war but the presenc of a better life remark by presid obama in address to the unit nation gener assembli septemb in the unit nation gener assembli hall new york citi new york usa we hope over fear we see the futur not a someth out of our control but a someth we can shape for the better through concert and collect effort we reject fatal or cynic when it come to human affair we to work for the world a it should be a our children deserv it to be and we call upon other to join u the right side of histori for while small gain can be won at the barrel of a gun thei will ultim be turn if enough voic support the freedom of nation and peopl to make their own decision if the world act togeth we can make sure that all of our children enjoi live of opportun and digniti i have made it clear that america will not base our entir foreign polici react to terror instead we’ve wage a focus campaign against al qaeda and it associ forc take out their leader deni them the safe haven thei reli at the same time we have reaffirm again and again that the unit state i not and never will be at war with islam islam teach peac muslim the world over aspir to live with digniti and a sens of justic and when it come to america and islam there i no u and them there i onli u becaus million of muslim american ar part of the fabric of our countri so we reject ani suggest of a clash of civil belief in perman religi war i the misguid refug of extremist who cannot build or creat anyth and therefor peddl onli fanatic and hate and it i no exagger to sai that humanity’s futur depend u unit against those who would divid u along the fault line of tribe or sect race or religion those who continu to fight for a hate caus will find thei ar increasingli alon for we will not succumb to threat and we will demonstr that the futur belong to those who build not those who destroi you have demonstr that when young peopl have the tool to succe good school educ in math and scienc an economi that nurtur creativ and entrepreneurship then societi will flourish where women ar full particip in a country’s polit or economi societi ar more like to succe if young peopl live in place where the onli option i between the dictat of a state or the lure of an extremist underground then no counterterror strategi can succe but where a genuin civil societi i allow to flourish where peopl can express their view and organ peacefulli for a better life then you dramat expand the altern to terror now ultim the task of reject sectarian and reject extrem i a gener task and a task for the peopl of the middl east themselv no extern power can bring about a transform of heart and mind but america will be a respect and construct partner we will neither toler terrorist safe haven nor act a an occupi power we will take action against threat to our secur and our alli while build an architectur of counterterror cooper we will increas effort to lift up those who counter extremist ideologi and who seek to resolv sectarian conflict and we will expand our program to support entrepreneurship and civil societi educ and youth becaus ultim these invest ar the best antidot to violenc so thi i what america i prepar to do take action against immedi threat while pursu a world in which the ne for such action i diminish the unit state will never shy awai from defend our interest but we
