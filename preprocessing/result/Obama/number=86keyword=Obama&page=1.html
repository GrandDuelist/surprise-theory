i that a on journalist note there i a big differ between be somber and be seriou and gravita with which obama overflow seem often just a karaok version of serious barack obama didn t kill liber he s just do a nice job of buri it the end of liber a a meaning ideologi came with the nomin of bill clinton the argum wa although hardli phrase so accur that it wa far better for liber to dump their

reason that willi sutton said he rob bank becaus that s where the monei i the littl avail evid suggest that obama would more like be a disappoint than a disgrac still in the end it s a sad choic

the waysid in favor of issu that no matter how worthi thei mai be ar most like to alien liber from the largest number of american thi then i obama s problem now not so much that he s an elitist but that he s surround by them fund by them guid by them and for too long ha been try to imit them if ed rendel wa not so foolishli infatu with the latest pretend to the bush clinton duopoli he might take

all but ignor the long list of scandal in hillari clinton s past in favor of such thing a posit coverag of how she cynic respond to mention of her husband s impeach obama i plai thi same card for all it worth he know full well that the presid i not about the audac of hope and that even if it were he ha no right to control it download a though he wa the ceo of the riaa of optim obama i engag in a sophist con with a long histori in thi countri we normal associ it with evangel the elmer gantri and the jerri falwel but the scam can be us by liber a well born again liber can turn their back realiti a well a ani conserv find solac in the comfort chicken soup of faith and hope the problem of cours i that realiti just keep truckin along and american ne far more than clich to get them through the next few year while obama i clearli be intellectu dishonest thi i to be sure a lesser sin than the congenit varieti practic by hi lead oppon the littl avail evid suggest that obama would more like be a disappoint than a disgrac still in the end it s a sad choic between the venal and the vacuum why obama attract the right sam smith harri truman remark that whenev anyon said thei were

moder rescu hi wife from the hand of the ravish tell the mother to gradual extric her babe from the fire into which it ha fallen the myth of the happi center i a major illusion domin public life in washington but the truth i that from that internecin struggl of two faction of the american middl known a the civil war to fbi assault activist organ in the s and s from the palmer raid to anti terror legisl american have tradition had more to fear from peopl thei have elect than from those the fring of polit in fact the latter have often serv larg a an excus for the american center to tighten it grip the polit and econom system thi i not to sai that the left and the right would not enjoi be just a violent and repress given the chanc but the american center ha rare allow that even the kkk so often cite a an exampl of the sort of threat the non center pose wa power primarili becaus it wa at the center hold polit and judici and law enforc offic a well a hide beneath it robe in some town lynch parti were even announc in the local paper and in the s both the colorado governor and mayor of denver were member of the klan the latter well enough regard to have had stapleton airport name

new yorker purveyor of the appropri to the liber elit featur obama a the concili with hardli a solid program or polici mention the messag of the articl like obama s i that we don t ne a presid just a therapist take healthcar for exampl we ve got to put more monei in prevent he said it make no sens for children to be go to the emerg room for treatabl ailment like asthma twenti per cent of our patient who have chronic ill account for eighti per cent of the cost so it s absolut critic that we invest in manag those with chronic ill like diabet if we hire a case manag to work with them to insur that thei re take the proper treatment then potenti we re not go to have to spend thirti thousand dollar a leg amput a young man ask about health care for minor obes and diabet in minor commun ar more sever obama said so i think we ne target program particularli to children in those commun to make sure that thei ve got sound nutrition that thei have access to fruit and veget and not just popey and that thei have decent space to plai in instead of be coop up in the hous all dai so just eat your veget and stai awai from popey and all will be fine press the matter obama doe go a littl deeper if you re start from scratch he sai then a singl payer system a govern manag system like canada s which disconnect health insur from employ would probabl make sens but we ve got all these legaci system in place and manag the transition a well a adjust the cultur to a differ system would be difficult to pull off so we mai ne a system that s not so disrupt that peopl feel like suddenli what thei ve known for most of their live i thrown by the waysid sinc ordinari peopl could adapt sai to the expans of the medicar system in a matter of dai who ar these peopl of whom obama speak who might feel like suddenli what thei ve known for most of their live i thrown by the waysid well the insur compani would be the on most affect and obama ha just sent a clear if covert signal that he won t be mess with them the right understand the centrist myth far better than liber thei know that the center i homeland secur for inact in public lot of action behind the scene and power stai where it should with the power it s not surpris that some of them see obama a their man the black reagan a he ha been call yet he i also the liber pat robertson and while the right can see where thei can cut deal with him the liber evangel ar all misti ei by hi talk of hope and faith but harri truman wa right that gui serv you the happi meal of centrism in the campaign i like go to be the other side after elect dai a few thing to forget about when support obama why the media i push obama obama imperialist in dove s cloth mind you thi isn t an attack kagan like it all not all that surpris sinc he i with

affair last week wa pure john kennedi without a trace of john mearsheim no on speak of the free world these dai and obama s insist that we not cede our claim of leadership in world affair will sound like an anachronist conceit to mani european who even in the s complain about the bulli hyperpow in moscow and beij it will confirm suspicion about america s inher hegemon but obama believ the world yearn to follow u if onli we restor our worthi to lead hi critiqu i not that we ve meddl too much but that we haven t meddl enough there i more to build democraci than depos a dictat and set up a

sam smith here s on reason barack obama talk so much about the audac of hope hi polici ar so meek for exampl he i clearli afraid to get anywher near singl payer healthcar so he come up with a plan where the feder govern would subsid the auto compani healthcar in return for more fuel effici car asid from the fact that thi i in opposit to far wiser effort to disassoci healthcar from the work

almost that much of aa with georg bush we should be burn out psycho therapeut a oppos to physic realiti but sadli mani ar taken in by obama s covert messag that if you trust in hope you don t have to worri about the detail like pension and healthcar there ar sever problem with thi on i that no on ha present the slightest evid of why obama s hope and faith i better than that of ani of the other
