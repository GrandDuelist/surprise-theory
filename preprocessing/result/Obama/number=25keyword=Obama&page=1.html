problem the children of america ar not those kid thei ar our kid and we will not let them fall behind in a st centuri economi not thi time chang i come to america in america we have thi strong bia toward individu action you know we idol the john wayn hero who come in to correct thing with both gun blaze but individu action individu dream ar not suffici we must unit in collect action build collect institut and organ in washington the call thi the ownership societi and it i especi tempt becaus each of u believ we will alwai be the winner in life s lotteri that we re the on who will be the next donald trump or at least we won t be the chump who donald trump sai you re fire in america we have thi strong bia toward individu action you know we idol the john wayn hero who come in to

re fire to avoid be mistaken for a sellout i chose my friend carefulli the more polit activ black student the foreign student the chicano the marxist professor and the structur feminist and punk rock perform poet we smoke cigarett and wore leather jacket at night in the dorm we discuss neocoloni franz fanon eurocentr and patriarchi when we ground our cigarett in the hallwai carpet or set our stereo so loud that the wall began to shake we were resist bourgeoi societi s stifl constraint we weren t indiffer or careless or insecur we were alien visit ireland my name i barack obama of the moneygal o bama and i ve come to find the apostroph we lost along the wai hopefulli more and more peopl will begin to feel their stori i somehow a part of the larger stori of how we re go to reshap america in a wai that i less mean spirit and more gener i mean i realli hope to be a part of the transform of thi countri i m not interest in the suburb the suburb bore me and i m not interest in isol myself i feel good when i m engag in what i think ar the core issu of the societi and those issu to me ar what s happen to poor folk in thi societi it s crucial that peopl don t see my elect a a sign of progress in the broader sens that we don t sort of point to a barack obama ani more than you point to a bill cosbi or a michael jordan and sai well thing ar hunki dori to that extent a radic a i think peopl try to character the warren court it wasn t that radic it didn t break free from the essenti constraint that were place by the found father in the constitut or at least a it s been interpret and warren court interpret in the same wai that gener the constitut i a charter of neg liberti sai what the state can t do to you sai what the feder govern can t do to you but doesn t sai what the feder govern or the state govern must do your behalf and that ha shift and on of the i think tragedi of the civil right movem wa um becaus the civil right movem becam so court focus i think there wa a tendenc to lose track of the polit and commun organ and activ the ground that ar abl to put togeth the actual coalition of power through which you bring about redistribut chang in some wai we still suffer from that anger over welfar and affirm action help forg the reagan coalition politician routin exploit fear of crime for their own elector end talk show host and conserv comment built entir career unmask bogu claim of racism while dismiss legitim discuss of racial injustic and inequ a mere polit correct or revers racism you go into these small town in pennsylvania and like a lot of small town in the midwest the job have been gone now for year and noth s replac them and thei fell through the clinton administr and the bush administr and each success administr ha said somehow these commun ar go to regener and thei have not and it s not surpris then thei get bitter thei cling to gun or religion or antipathi toward peopl who aren t like them or anti immigr sentim or anti trade sentim a a wai to explain their frustrat it s great to be here thi even in the vast magnific hilton ballroom or what mitt romnei would call a littl fixer upper you know malia and sasha thei have friend whose parent ar same sex coupl there have been time where michel and i have been sit around the dinner tabl and we re talk about their friend and their parent and malia and sasha it wouldn t dawn them that somehow their friend parent would be treat differ it doesn t make sens to them and frankli that s the kind of thing that prompt a chang in perspect mai i have to tell you that over the cours of sever year a i have talk to friend and famili and neighbor when i think about member of my own staff who ar in incred commit monogam relationship same sex relationship who ar rais kid togeth when i think about those soldier or airmen or marin or sailor who ar out there fight my behalf and yet feel constrain even now that don t ask don t tell i gone becaus thei ar not abl to commit themselv in a marriag at a certain point i ve just conclud that for me person it i import for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same sex coupl should be abl to get marri mai i believ the major of gun owner would agre we should do everyth possibl to prevent crimin and fugit from purchas weapon and we should someon s crimin record befor thei can out a gun seller a mental unbalanc individu should not be abl to get hi hand a gun so easili these step shouldn t be controversi thei should be common sens we can t continu to sustain a situat in which some countri ar maintain surplus other massiv deficit and there never i the kind of adjust with respect to currenc that would lead to a more balanc growth pattern my imag of onyango faint a it wa ha alwai been of an autocrat man a cruel man perhap but i had also imagin him an independ man a man of hi peopl oppos to white rule what granni had told u scrambl that imag complet caus ugli word to flash across my mind uncl tom collabor hous nigger the onli wai my life make sens i if regardless of cultur race religion tribe there i thi common these essenti human truth and passion and hope and moral precept that we can reach out beyond our differ if that i not the case then it i pretti hard for me to make sens of my life that i the core of who i am elect night novemb thi i your victori i will ask you to join in the work of remak thi nation the onli wai it s been done in america for year block by block brick by brick callus hand by callus hand the polit choic a he see it in thi isn t a matter of who s more patriot or who i more empathet toward peopl or who i nicer it s a hardhead assess of what make our economi grow and the fact ar my side in thi argum part of the reason that our polit seem so tough right now and fact and scienc and argum doe not seem to be win the dai all the time i becaus we re hardwir not to think clearli when we re scare what i wake up determin to accomplish everi singl dai i make the best decision i can and the onli thing then to guid you i what you genuin think i best for the countri becaus if you try to guess what s go to be most polit advantag or try to game all that stuff out you ll get lost veri quickli we can t drive our suv and eat a much a we want and keep our home degre at all time and then just expect that other countri ar go to sai ok that s not leadership that s not go to happen i do think at a certain point you ve made enough monei if you were success somebodi along the line gave you some help there wa a great teacher somewher in your life somebodi help to creat thi unbeliev american system that we have allow you to thrive somebodi invest in road and bridg if you ve got a busi you didn t build that somebodi els made that happen governor romnei seem to have a tendenc to shoot first and aim later a presid of our countri and command in chief of our militari i accept that peopl ar go to call me aw thing everi dai and i will alwai defend their right to do so if you can t beat your oppon s idea you distort those idea and mayb make some up if you don t have a record to run than you paint your oppon a someon peopl should run awai from donald trump s refus to trust the valid of the presid s person docum thi all date to when we were grow up togeth in kenya i ve alwai believ that educ begin at home with parent who take respons who read to their kid set limit the tv and instil a lifelong love of learn but there i no substitut for a good school or the teacher who stand in front of the classroom to the crowd at the presidenti inaugur i want to look out on more time i m not go to see thi again the truth i that we have steadili becom a more divers and toler countri that embrac peopl s differ and respect peopl who ar not like u that s a profoundli good thing that s on of the strength of america the campaign trail if you bui into the cynic that the chang we fought for isn t possibl well chang will not happen other voic will fill the void lobbyist and special interest the peopl with ten million dollar check who ar try to bui thi elect senat tom coburn r oklahoma the peopl of oklahoma ar lucki to have someon like tom repres them in washington someon who speak hi mind stick to hi principl and i commit to the peopl he wa elect to serv each of u still hope the other will see the light but in the meantim we ll settl for be friend at the white hous

battlefield of war not the street of our citi nelson mandela i had read hi write and speech and understood thi wa somebodi who believ in the basic principl i just talk about treat peopl equal he wa will to sacrific hi life for that belief he s a person hero but i don t think i m uniqu in that regard he s a hero for the world if and when he pass from thi place on thing we all know i that hi
